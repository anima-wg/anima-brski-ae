<?line 148?>

<t>This document defines an enhancement of
Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI, RFC 8995).
It supports alternative certificate enrollment protocols, such as CMP, that
use authenticated self-contained signed objects for certification messages.</t>

<t>This offers the following advantages.
The origin of requests and responses
can be authenticated independently of message transfer.
This supports end-to-end authentication (proof of origin) also over
multiple hops, as well as asynchronous operation of certificate enrollment.
This in turn provides architectural flexibility where and when to
ultimately authenticate and authorize certification requests while retaining
full-strength integrity and authenticity of certification requests.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/> is typically used with Enrollment over Secure Transport
(EST, <xref target="RFC7030"/>) as the enrollment protocol
for device certificates employing HTTP over TLS for its message transfer.
BRSKI-AE is a variant using alternative enrollment protocols with
authenticated self-contained objects for device certificate enrollment.
<!--
This enhancement of BRSKI is named BRSKI-AE, where AE stands for
**A**lternative **E**nrollment.
(while originally it was used to abbreviate **A**synchronous **E**nrollment)
--></t>

<t>This specification carries over the main characteristics of BRSKI, namely:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The pledge is assumed to have received its Initial Device IDentifier
(IDevID, <xref target="IEEE_802.1AR-2018"/>) credentials during its production.
It uses them to authenticate itself to the
Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority (MASA, <xref target="RFC8995"/>),
and to the registrar, which is the access point of the target domain,
and to possibly further components of the domain where it will be operated.</t>
  <t>The pledge first obtains via the voucher exchange a trust anchor
for authenticating entities in the domain such as the domain registrar.</t>
  <t>The pledge then obtains its
Locally significant Device IDentifier (IDevID, <xref target="IEEE_802.1AR-2018"/>).
To this end, the pledge generates a private key, called LDevID secret,
and requests via the domain registar from the PKI of its new domain
a domain-specific device certificate, called LDevID certificate.
On success it receives the LDevID certificate along with its certificate chain.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The goals of BRSKI-AE are to provide an enhancement of BRSKI for
LDevID certificate enrollment using, alternatively to EST, a protocol that</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>supports end-to-end authentication over multiple hops</t>
  <t>enables secure message exchange over any kind of transfer,
including asynchronous delivery.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Note: The BRSKI voucher exchange of the pledge with the registrar and MASA
uses authenticated self-contained objects,
so the voucher exchange already has these properties.</t>

<t>The well-known URI approach of BRSKI and EST messages is extended
with an additional path element indicating the enrollment protocol being used.
<!--- not really: and
* defining a certificate waiting indication and handling, for the case that the
  certifying component is (temporarily) not available.
--></t>

<t>Based on the definition of the overall approach and specific endpoints,
this specification enables the registrar to offer multiple enrollment protocols,
from which pledges and their developers can then pick the most suitable one.</t>

<t>Note: BRSKI (RFC 8995) specifies how to use HTTP over TLS, but further variants
are known, such as
Constrained BRSKI <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-constrained-voucher"/> using CoAP over DTLS.
In the sequel, 'HTTP' and 'TLS' are just references to the most common case,
where variants such as using CoAP and/or DTLS are meant to be subsumed -
the differences are not relevant here.</t>

<t>This specification is sufficient together with its references to
support BRSKI with the Certificate Management Protocol (CMP, <xref target="RFC9480"/>)
profiled in the Lightweight CMP Profile (LCMPP, <xref target="RFC9483"/>).
Combining BRSKI with a protocol or profile other than LCMPP will require
additional IANA registrations based on the rules specified in this document.
It may also require additional specifications for details of the protocol or
profile (similar to <xref target="RFC9483"></xref>), which are outside the scope of this document.</t>

<section anchor="sup-env"><name>Supported Scenarios</name>

<t>BRSKI-AE is intended to be used situations like the following.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>pledges and/or the target domain reusing an already established
certificate enrollment protocol different from EST, such as CMP.</t>
  <t>scenarios indirectly excluding the use of EST for certificate enrollment,
such as:
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>the registration Authority (RA) not being co-located with the registrar
while requiring end-to-end
authentication of requesters, which EST does not support over multiple hops</t>
      <t>the RA or certification authority (CA) operator requiring
auditable proof of origin for Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs), which is
not possible neither with the transient source authentication provided by TLS.</t>
      <t>certificate requests for types of keys that do not support signing,
such as Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) and key agreement keys,
which is not supported by EST because it uses CSR in PKCS #10 <xref target="RFC2986"/>
format expecting proof-of-possession via a self-signature</t>
      <t>pledge implementations using security libraries not providing EST support or
a TLS library that does not support providing the so-called tls-unique value
<xref target="RFC5929"/> needed by EST for strong binding of the source authentication</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>no full RA functionality being available on-site in the target domain, while
connectivity to an off-site RA may be intermittent or entirely offline.
<!-- in the latter case a message store-and-forward mechanism is needed. --></t>
  <t>authoritative actions of a local RA at the registrar being not sufficient
for fully and reliably authorizing pledge certification requests, which
may be due to missing data access or due to an insufficient level of security,
for instance regarding the local storage of private keys
<!-- Final authorization then is done by a RA residing in the backend. --></t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="req-sol"><name>Basic Requirements and Mapping to Solutions</name>

<t>Based on the intended target scenarios described in <xref target="sup-env"/> and
the application examples described in <xref target="app-examples"/>, the following
requirements are derived to support authenticated self-contained objects
as containers carrying certification requests.</t>

<t>At least the following properties are required for a certification request:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Proof of possession: demonstrates access to the private
key corresponding to the public key contained in a certification request.
This is typically achieved by a self-signature using the corresponding
private key but can also be achieved indirectly, see <xref section="4.3" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC4210"/>.</t>
  <t>Proof of identity, also called proof of origin:
provides data origin authentication of the certification request.
Typically this is achieved by a signature using the pledge IDevID secret
over some data, which needs to include a sufficiently strong identifier
of the pledge, such as the device serial number
typically included in the subject of the IDevID certificate.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The rest of this section gives an non-exhaustive list of solution examples,
based on existing technology described in IETF documents:</t>

<section anchor="solutions-PoP"><name>Solution Options for Proof of Possession</name>

<t>Certificate signing request (CSR) objects: CSRs are
  data structures protecting only the integrity of the contained data
  and providing proof of possession for a (locally generated) private key.
  Important types of CSR data structures are:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>PKCS #10 <xref target="RFC2986"/>. This very common form of CSR is
self-signed to protect its integrity and to prove possession of
the private key that corresponds to the public key included in the request.</t>
  <t>Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF, <xref target="RFC4211"/>).
This less common but more general CSR format
supports several ways of integrity protection and proof of possession-
Typically a self-signature is used generated over (part of) the structure
with the private key corresponding to the included public key.
CRMF also supports further proof-of-possession methods for types of keys
that do not have signing capability. For details see <xref section="4" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC4211"/>.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Note: The integrity protection of CSRs includes the public key
  because it is part of the data signed by the corresponding private key.
  Yet this signature does not provide data origin authentication, i.e.,
  proof of identity of the requester because the key pair involved is fresh.
  <!-- already covered by the next paragraph:
  This extra property can be
  achieved by an additional binding to the IDevID of the pledge.
  This binding to the source authentication supports the
  authorization decision of the certification request.
  --></t>

</section>
<section anchor="solutions-PoI"><name>Solution Options for Proof of Identity</name>

<t>Binding a certificate signing request (CSR) to an existing authenticated
  credential (the BRSKI context, the IDevID certificate) enables
  proof of origin, which in turn supports an authorization decision on the CSR.</t>

<t>The binding of data origin authentication to the CSR
  is typically delegated to the protocol used for certificate management.
  This binding may be achieved through security options in an
  underlying transport protocol such as TLS if the authorization of the
  certification request is (sufficiently) done at the next communication hop.
  Depending on the key type, the binding can also be done in a stronger,
  transport-independent way by wrapping the CSR with a signature.</t>

<t>This requirement is addressed by existing enrollment protocols
  in various ways, such as:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>EST <xref target="RFC7030"/>, also its variant EST-coaps <xref target="RFC9148"/>,
utilizes PKCS #10 to encode Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs).
While such a CSR was not designed
to include a proof of origin, there is a limited, indirect way of
binding it to the source authentication of the underlying TLS session.
This is achieved by including in the CSR the tls-unique value <xref target="RFC5929"/>
resulting from the TLS handshake.  As this is optionally supported
by the EST <spanx style="verb">"/simpleenroll"</spanx> endpoint used in BRSKI
and the TLS handshake employed in BRSKI includes certificate-based client
authentication of the pledge with its IDevID credentials, the proof of
pledge identity being an authenticated TLS client can be bound to the CSR.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Yet this binding is only valid in the context of the TLS session
established with the registrar acting as the EST server and typically also
as an RA.  So even such a cryptographic binding of the authenticated
pledge identity to the CSR is not visible nor verifiable to authorization
points outside the registrar, such as a (second) RA in the backend.
What the registrar must do is to authenticate and pre-authorize the pledge
and to indicate this to the (second) RA
by signing the forwarded certificate request with its private key and
a related certificate that has the id-kp-cmcRA extended key usage attribute.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
<xref section="2.5" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC7030"/> sketches wrapping PKCS #10-formatted CSRs
with a Full PKI Request message sent to the <spanx style="verb">"/fullcmc"</spanx> endpoint.
This would allow for source authentication at message level, such that
the registrar could forward it to external RAs in a meaningful way.
This approach is so far not sufficiently described
and likely has not been implemented.</t>
</list></t>

<!--
Note that, besides the existing enrollment protocols, there is
ongoing work in the ACE WG to define an encapsulation of EST messages
in OSCORE, which will result in a TLS-independent way of protecting EST.
This approach {{draft.selander-ace-coap-est-oscore}}
may be considered as a further variant.
-->

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>SCEP <xref target="RFC8894"/> supports using a shared secret (passphrase) or
an existing certificate to protect CSRs based on
SCEP Secure Message Objects using CMS wrapping
(<xref target="RFC5652"/>). Note that the wrapping using
an existing IDevID in SCEP is referred to as 'renewal'.
This way
SCEP does not rely on the security of the underlying message transfer.</t>
  <t>CMP <xref target="RFC4210"/> <xref target="RFC9480"/> supports using a shared secret (passphrase)
or an existing
certificate, which may be an IDevID credential, to authenticate
certification requests via the PKIProtection structure in a PKIMessage.
The certification request is typically encoded utilizing CRMF,
while PKCS #10 is supported as an alternative.
Thus, CMP does not rely on the security of the underlying message transfer.</t>
  <t>CMC <xref target="RFC5272"/> also supports utilizing a shared secret (passphrase) or
an existing certificate to protect certification requests,
which can be either in CRMF or PKCS #10 structure.
The proof of identity can be provided as part of a FullCMCRequest,
based on CMS <xref target="RFC5652"/> and signed with an existing IDevID secret.
Thus
also CMC does not rely on the security of the underlying message transfer.</t>
</list></t>

<t>To sum up, EST does not meet the requirements for authenticated self-contained
objects, but SCEP, CMP, and CMC do. This document primarily focuses on CMP as
it has more industrial relevance than CMC and SCEP has issues not detailed here.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="uc1"><name>Adaptations to BRSKI</name>

<t>To enable using alternative certificate enrollment protocols supporting end-to-end
authentication, asynchronous enrollment, and more general system architectures,
BRSKI-AE provides some generalizations on BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
This way, authenticated self-contained objects such as those described in
<xref target="req-sol"/> above can be used for certificate enrollment,
and RA functionality can be distributed freely in the target domain.</t>

<t>The enhancements needed are kept to a minimum in order to ensure reuse of
already defined architecture elements and interactions.
In general, the communication follows the BRSKI model and utilizes the existing
BRSKI architecture elements.
In particular, the pledge initiates communication with the domain registrar and
interacts with the MASA as usual for voucher request and response processing.</t>

<section anchor="architecture"><name>Architecture</name>

<t>The key element of BRSKI-AE is that the authorization of a certification request
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be performed based on an authenticated self-contained object.
The certification request is bound in a self-contained way
to a proof of origin based on the IDevID credentials.
Consequently, the certification request may be transferred using any mechanism
or protocol. Authentication and authorization of the certification request
can be done by the domain registrar and/or by backend domain components.
As mentioned in <xref target="sup-env"/>, these components may be offline or off-site.
The registrar and other on-site domain components
may have no or only temporary (intermittent) connectivity to them.</t>

<t>This leads to generalizations in the
placement and enhancements of the logical elements as shown in <xref target="uc1figure"/>.</t>

<t>The architecture overview in <xref target="uc1figure"/>
has the same logical elements as BRSKI, but with more flexible placement
of the authentication and authorization checks on certification requests.
Depending on the application scenario, the registrar <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> still do all of these
checks (as is the case in BRSKI), or part of them.</t>

<t>The following list describes the on-site components in the target domain
of the pledge shown in <xref target="uc1figure"/>.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Join Proxy: same functionality as described in BRSKI <xref section="4" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/></t>
  <t>Domain Registrar including LRA or RA functionality: in BRSKI-AE,
the domain registrar has mostly the same functionality as in BRSKI, namely
to act as the gatekeeper of the domain for onboarding new devices and
to facilitate the communication of pledges with their MASA and the domain PKI.
Yet there are some generalizations and specific requirements:  <list style="numbers">
      <t>The registrar <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support at least one certificate enrollment protocol
with authenticated self-contained objects for certification requests.
To this end, the URI scheme for addressing endpoints at the registrar
is generalized (see <xref target="addressing"/>).</t>
      <t>Rather than having full RA functionality, the registrar <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> act as
a local registration authority (LRA) and delegate part of its involvement
in certificate enrollment to a backend RA, called RA.
In such scenarios the registrar optionally checks certification requests
it receives from pledges and forwards them to the RA. The RA performs
the remaining parts of the enrollment request validation and authorization.
Note that to this end the RA may need information regarding
the authorization of pledges from the registrar or from other sources.
On the way back, the registrar forwards responses by the PKI
to the pledge on the same channel.      <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Note:
In order to support end-to-end authentication of the pledge across the
registrar to the RA, the certification request structure signed by
the pledge needs to be retained by the registrar,
and the registrar cannot use for its communication with
the PKI a enrollment protocol different to the one used by the pledge.</t>
      <t>The use of a certificate enrollment protocol with
authenticated self-contained objects gives freedom how to transfer
enrollment messages between pledge and RA.
Regardless how this transfer is protected and how messages are routed,
also in case that the RA is not part of the registrar
it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be guaranteed, like in BRSKI, that the RA accepts
certification requests for LDevIDs only with the consent of the registrar.
See <xref target="sec-consider"/> for details how this can be achieved.</t>
    </list></t>
</list></t>

<!-- is already covered by paragraph a little further below:
     Note:
     As far as (at least part of) the certificate enrollment traffic is routed
     via the registrar, BRSKI-AE re-uses during the certificate enrollment phase
     the channel that has been established in the BRSKI steps before between the
     pledge and the registrar.  Consequently, tunneling via this channel needs
     to be supported by the certificate enrollment protocol.
     By default, this channel is based on HTTP over TLS,
     but it may also be based on, for instance, CoAP over DTLS
     in the context of Constrained BRSKI {{I-D.ietf-anima-constrained-voucher}}.
-->
<!--
     In the latter scenario,
     the EST-specific parts of that specification do not apply.
-->

<t>Despite of the above generalizations to the enrollment phase, the final
step of BRSKI, namely the enrollment status telemetry, is kept as it is.</t>

<t>The following list describes the components provided by
the vendor or manufacturer outside the target domain.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>MASA: functionality as described in BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
The voucher exchange with the MASA via the domain registrar
is performed as described in BRSKI.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Note: From the definition of the interaction with the MASA in
<xref section="5" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/> follows that it may be synchronous (using voucher
request with nonces) or asynchronous (using nonceless voucher requests).</t>
  <t>Ownership tracker: as defined in BRSKI.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The following list describes backend target domain components,
which may be located on-site or off-site in the target domain.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>RA: performs centralized certificate management functions
as a public-key infrastructure for the domain operator.
As far as not already done by the domain registrar, it performs the final
validation and authorization of certification requests.  Otherwise,
the RA co-located with the domain registrar directly connects to the CA.</t>
  <t>CA, also called domain CA: generates domain-specific certificates
according to certification requests that have been
authenticated and authorized by the registrar and/or and an extra RA.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Based on the diagram in BRSKI <xref section="2.1" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/> and the architectural
changes, the original protocol flow is divided into several phases
showing commonalities and differences to the original approach as follows.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Discovery phase: mostly as in BRSKI step (1). For details see <xref target="discovery"/>.</t>
  <t>Identification phase: same as in BRSKI step (2).</t>
  <t>Voucher exchange phase: same as in BRSKI steps (3) and (4).</t>
  <t>Voucher status telemetry: same as in BRSKI directly after step (4).</t>
  <t>Certificate enrollment phase: the use of EST in step (5) is changed
to employing a certificate enrollment protocol that uses
an authenticated self-contained object for requesting the LDevID certificate.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
For transporting the certificate enrollment request and response messages, the
(D)TLS channel established between pledge and registrar is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> to use.
To this end, the enrollment protocol, the pledge, and the registrar
need to support the usage of the existing channel for certificate enrollment.
Due to this recommended architecture, typically the pledge does not need
to establish additional connections for certificate enrollment and
the registrar retains full control over the certificate enrollment traffic.</t>
  <t>Enrollment status telemetry: the final exchange of BRSKI step (5).</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="message_ex"><name>Message Exchange</name>

<t>The behavior of a pledge described in BRSKI <xref section="2.1" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/>
is kept, with one major exception.
After finishing the Imprint step (4), the Enroll step (5) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be performed
with an enrollment protocol utilizing authenticated self-contained objects,
as explained in <xref target="req-sol"/>.
<!--
the certificate request MUST be performed using an
authenticated self-contained object providing not only proof of possession
but also proof of identity (source authentication).
-->
<xref target="exist_prot"/> discusses selected suitable enrollment protocols
and options applicable.</t>

<t>An abstract overview of the BRSKI-AE protocol
can be found at <xref target="BRSKI-AE-overview"/>.</t>

<section anchor="discovery"><name>Pledge - Registrar Discovery</name>

<t>Discovery as specified in BRSKI <xref section="4" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/> does not support
discovery of registrars with enhanced feature sets.
A pledge cannot find out in this way whether discovered registrars
support the certificate enrollment protocol it expects, such as CMP.</t>

<t>As a more general solution, the BRSKI discovery mechanism can be extended
to provide upfront information on the capabilities of registrars.
Future work such as <xref target="I-D.eckert-anima-brski-discovery"/> may provide this.</t>

<t>In the absence of such a generally applicable solution,
BRSKI-AE deployments may use their particular way of doing discovery.
<xref target="brski-cmp-instance"/> defines a minimalist approach that <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used for CMP.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="pledge-registrar-masa-voucher-exchange"><name>Pledge - Registrar - MASA Voucher Exchange</name>

<t>The voucher exchange is performed as specified in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="pledge-registrar-masa-voucher-status-telemetry"><name>Pledge - Registrar - MASA Voucher Status Telemetry</name>

<t>The voucher status telemetry is performed
as specified in <xref section="5.7" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="pledge-registrar-raca-certificate-enrollment"><name>Pledge - Registrar - RA/CA Certificate Enrollment</name>

<t>This replaces the EST integration for PKI bootstrapping described in
<xref section="5.9" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/>
(while <xref section="5.9.4" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/> remains as the final phase, see below).</t>

<t>The certificate enrollment phase may involve transmission of several messages.
Details can depend on the application scenario,
the employed enrollment protocol, and other factors.
<!-- <br>
In line with the generalizations described in {{architecture}},
It is RECOMMENDED to transfer these messages
via the channel established between the pledge and the registrar.
--></t>

<t>The only message exchange <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> is for
the actual certificate request and response.
Further message exchanges <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be performed as needed.</t>

<t>Note:
The message exchanges marked <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> in the below <xref target="enrollfigure"/>
cover all those supported by the use of EST in BRSKI.
The last <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> one, namely certificate confirmation,
is not supported by EST, but by CMP and other enrollment protocols.</t>

]]></artwork></artset></figure>

<t>Note: Connections between the registrar and the PKI components
of the operator (RA, CA, etc.) may be intermittent or off-line.
Messages should be sent as soon as sufficient transfer capacity is available.</t>

<t>The label <spanx style="verb">[OPTIONAL forwarding]</spanx> in <xref target="enrollfigure"/>
means that on receiving from a pledge a request message of the given type,
the registrar <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> answer the request directly itself.
In this case, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> authenticate its responses with the same credentials
as used for authenticating itself at TLS level for the voucher exchange.
Otherwise the registrar <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> forward the request to the RA
and forward any resulting response back to the pledge.</t>

<t>Note:
The decision whether to forward a request or to answer it directly can depend
on various static and dynamic factors. They include the application scenario,
the capabilities of the registrar and of the local RA possibly co-located
with the registrar, the enrollment protocol being used, and the specific
contents of the request.</t>

<t>Note:
There are several options how the registrar could be able to directly answer
requests for CA certificates or for certificate request attributes.
It could cache responses obtained from the domain PKI and
later use their contents for responding to requests asking for the same data.
The contents could also be explicit provisioned at the registrar.</t>

<t>Note:
Certificate requests typically need to be handled by the backend PKI,
but the registrar can answer them directly with an error response
in case it determines that such a request should be rejected,
for instance because is not properly authenticated or not authorized.<br />
Also certificate confirmation messages
will usually be forwarded to the backend PKI,
but if the registrar knows that they are not needed or wanted there
it can acknowledge such messages directly.</t>

<t>The following list provides an abstract description of the flow
depicted in <xref target="enrollfigure"/>.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>CA Certs Request (1): The pledge optionally requests the latest relevant
CA certificates. This ensures that the pledge has the
complete set of current CA certificates beyond the
pinned-domain-cert (which is contained in the voucher
and may be just the domain registrar certificate).</t>
  <t>CA Certs Response (2): This <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain any intermediate CA certificates
that the pledge may need to validate certificates
and <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> contain the LDevID trust anchor.</t>
  <t>Attribute Request (3): Typically, the automated bootstrapping occurs
without local administrative configuration of the pledge.
Nevertheless, there are cases in which the pledge may also
include additional attributes specific to the target domain
into the certification request. To get these attributes in
advance, the attribute request may be used.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
For example, <xref section="6.11.7.2" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8994"/> specifies
how the attribute request is used to signal to the pledge
the acp-node-name field required for enrollment into an ACP domain.</t>
  <t>Attribute Response (4): This <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain the attributes to be included
in the subsequent certification request.</t>
  <t>Certificate Request (5): This <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain the
authenticated self-contained object ensuring both proof of possession of the
corresponding private key and proof of identity of the requester.</t>
  <t>Certificate Response (6): This <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain on success
the requested certificate and <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> include further information,
like certificates of intermediate CAs and any additional trust anchors.</t>
  <t>Certificate Confirm (7): An optional confirmation sent
after the requested certificate has been received and validated.
If sent, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain a positive or negative confirmation by the pledge to
the PKI whether the certificate was successfully enrolled and fits its needs.</t>
  <t>PKI/Registrar Confirm (8): An acknowledgment by the PKI
that <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be sent on reception of the Cert Confirm.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The generic messages described above may be implemented using any certificate
enrollment protocol that supports authenticated self-contained objects for the
certificate request as described in <xref target="req-sol"/>.
Examples are available in <xref target="exist_prot"/>.</t>

<t>Note that the optional certificate confirmation by the pledge to the PKI
described above is independent of the mandatory enrollment status telemetry
done between the pledge and the registrar in the final phase of BRSKI-AE,
described next.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="pledge-registrar-enrollment-status-telemetry"><name>Pledge - Registrar Enrollment Status Telemetry</name>

<t>The enrollment status telemetry is performed
as specified in <xref section="5.9.4" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/>.</t>

<t>In BRSKI this is described as part of the certificate enrollment step, but
due to the generalization on the enrollment protocol described in this document
its regarded as a separate phase here.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="addressing"><name>Enhancements to the Endpoint Addressing Scheme of BRSKI</name>

<t>BRSKI-AE provides generalizations to the addressing scheme defined in
BRSKI <xref section="5" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/> to accommodate alternative enrollment protocols
that use authenticated self-contained objects for certification requests.
As this is supported by various existing enrollment protocols,
they can be employed without modifications to existing RAs/CAs
supporting the respective enrollment protocol (see also <xref target="exist_prot"/>).</t>

<t>The addressing scheme in BRSKI for certification requests and
the related CA certificates and CSR attributes retrieval functions
uses the definition from EST <xref target="RFC7030"/>,
here on the example of simple enrollment: <spanx style="verb">"/.well-known/est/simpleenroll"</spanx>.
This approach is generalized to the following notation:
<spanx style="verb">"/.well-known/&lt;enrollment-protocol&gt;/&lt;request&gt;"</spanx>
in which <spanx style="verb">&lt;enrollment-protocol&gt;</spanx> refers to a certificate enrollment protocol.
Note that enrollment is considered here a message sequence
that contains at least a certification request and a certification response.
The following conventions are used to provide maximal compatibility with BRSKI:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t><spanx style="verb">&lt;enrollment-protocol&gt;</spanx>: <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reference the protocol being used.
Existing values include '<spanx style="verb">est</spanx>' <xref target="RFC7030"/> as in BRSKI and '<spanx style="verb">cmp</spanx>' as in
<xref target="RFC9483"/> and <xref target="brski-cmp-instance"/> below.
Values for other existing protocols such as CMC and SCEP,
or for newly defined protocols are outside the scope of this document.
For use of the <spanx style="verb">&lt;enrollment-protocol&gt;</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">&lt;request&gt;</spanx> URI components,
they would need to be specified in a suitable RFC and
placed into the Well-Known URIs registry, as for EST in <xref target="RFC7030"/>.</t>
  <t><spanx style="verb">&lt;request&gt;</spanx>: if present, this path component <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> describe,
depending on the enrollment protocol being used, the operation requested.
Enrollment protocols are expected to define their request endpoints,
as done by existing protocols (see also <xref target="exist_prot"/>).</t>
</list></t>

<!-- ## Domain Registrar Support of Alternative Enrollment Protocols -->

<t>Well-known URIs for various endpoints on the domain registrar are
already defined as part of the base BRSKI specification or indirectly by EST.
In addition, alternative enrollment endpoints <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be supported at the registrar.</t>

<t>A pledge <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use the endpoints defined for the enrollment protocol(s)
that it is capable of and is willing to use.
It will recognize whether its preferred protocol or the request that it tries
to perform is understood and supported by the domain registrar
by sending a request to its preferred enrollment endpoint according to the above
addressing scheme and evaluating the HTTP status code in the response.
If the pledge uses endpoints that are not standardized,
it risks that the registrar does not recognize and accept them
even if supporting the intended protocol and operation.</t>

<t>The following list of endpoints provides an illustrative example for
a domain registrar supporting several options for EST as well as for
CMP to be used in BRSKI-AE. The listing contains the supported
endpoints to which the pledge may connect for bootstrapping. This
includes the voucher handling as well as the enrollment endpoints.
The CMP-related enrollment endpoints are defined as well-known URIs
in CMP Updates <xref target="RFC9480"/> and the Lightweight CMP Profile <xref target="RFC9483"/>.</t>

<section anchor="exist_prot"><name>Instantiation to Existing Enrollment Protocols</name>

<t>This section maps the generic requirements to support proof of possession
and proof of identity to selected existing certificate enrollment protocols
and specifies further aspects of using such enrollment protocols in BRSKI-AE.</t>

<section anchor="brski-cmp-instance"><name>BRSKI-CMP: Instantiation to CMP</name>

<t>Instead of referring to CMP
as specified in <xref target="RFC4210"/> and <xref target="RFC9480"/>,
this document refers to the Lightweight CMP Profile (LCMPP)
<xref target="RFC9483"/> because
the subset of CMP defined there is sufficient for the functionality needed here.</t>

<t>When using CMP, adherence to
the LCMPP <xref target="RFC9483"/> is <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14>.
In particular, the following specific requirements apply (cf. <xref target="enrollfigure"/>).</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>CA Certs Request (1) and Response (2):<br />
Requesting CA certificates over CMP is <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14>.<br />
If supported, it <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be implemented as specified in
<xref section="4.3.1" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC9483"/>.</t>
  <t>Attribute Request (3) and Response (4):<br />
Requesting certificate request attributes over CMP is <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14>.<br />
If supported, it <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be implemented as specified in
<xref section="4.3.3" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC9483"/>.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Alternatively, the registrar <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> modify
the contents of requested certificate contents
as specified in <xref section="5.2.3.2" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC9483"/>.</t>
  <t>Certificate Request (5) and Response (6):<br />
Certificates <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be requested and provided
as specified in the LCMPP
<xref section="4.1.1" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC9483"/> (based on CRMF) or
<xref section="4.1.4" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC9483"/> (based on PKCS #10).  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Proof of possession <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be provided in a way suitable for the key type.
Proof of identity <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be provided by signature-based
protection of the certification request message
as outlined in <xref section="3.2" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC9483"/>
using the IDevID secret.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Note: When the registrar forwards a certification request by the pledge to
a backend RA, the registrar is recommended to wrap the original
certification request in a nested message signed with its own credentials
as described in <xref section="5.2.2.1" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC9483"/>.
This explicitly conveys the consent by the registrar to the RA
while retaining the certification request
with its proof of origin provided by the pledge signature.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
In case additional trust anchors (besides the pinned-domain-cert)
need to be conveyed to the pledge,
this <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be done in the <spanx style="verb">caPubs</spanx> field of the certificate response message
rather than in a CA Certs Response.</t>
  <t>Certificate Confirm (7) and PKI/Registrar Confirm (8):<br />
Explicit confirmation of new certificates to the RA/CA
<bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used as specified in
<xref section="4.1.1" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC9483"/>.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Note: Independently of certificate confirmation within CMP,
enrollment status telemetry with the registrar will be performed
as described in BRSKI <xref section="5.9.4" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/>.</t>
  <t>If delayed delivery of responses
(for instance, to support asynchronous enrollment) within CMP is needed,
it <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be performed as specified in
Section <xref target="RFC9483" section="4.4" sectionFormat="bare"/> and Section <xref target="RFC9483" section="5.1.2" sectionFormat="bare"/> of <xref target="RFC9483"/>.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Note:
The way in which messages are exchanged between the registrar and backend PKI
components (i.e., RA or CA) is out of scope of this document.
Due to the general independence of CMP of message transfer, it can be freely
chosen according to the needs of the application scenario (e.g., using HTTP),
while security considerations apply, see <xref target="sec-consider"/>, and
guidance can be found in <xref section="6" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC9483"/>.</t>

<!--
CMP Updates {{RFC9480}} and
the LCMPP {{RFC9483}}
provide requirements for interoperability.
-->

<t>BRSKI-AE with CMP can also be combined with
Constrained BRSKI <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-constrained-voucher"/>,
using CoAP for enrollment message transport as described by
CoAP Transport for CMP <xref target="I-D.ietf-ace-cmpv2-coap-transport"/>.
In this scenario, of course the EST-specific parts
of <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-constrained-voucher"/> do not apply.</t>

<t>For BRSKI-AE scenarios where a general solution (cf. <xref target="discovery"/>)
for discovering registrars with CMP support is not available,
the following minimalist approach <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used.
Perform discovery as defined in BRSKI <xref section="B" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/> but using
the service name <spanx style="verb">"brski-registrar-lcmpp"</spanx> (defined in <xref target="iana-consider"/>)
instead of <spanx style="verb">"brski-registrar"</spanx> (defined in <xref section="8.6" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/>).
Note that this approach does not support join proxies.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="support-of-other-enrollment-protocols"><name>Support of Other Enrollment Protocols</name>

<t>Further instantiations of BRSKI-AE can be done.  They are left for future work.</t>

<t>In particular, CMC <xref target="RFC5272"/> (using its in-band source authentication options)
and SCEP <xref target="RFC8894"/> (using its 'renewal' option) could be used.</t>

<t>The fullCMC variant of EST sketched in <xref section="2.5" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC7030"/>
might also be used here. For EST-fullCMC further specification is necessary.
<!--
Yet most likely it will not be followed up
because, by now, no implementations of this EST variant are known,
and no reasons are known why it could be preferable over using BRSKI-CMP.

<!--
 ## BRSKI-EST-fullCMC: Instantiation to EST

When using EST {{RFC7030}}, the following aspects and constraints
need to be considered and the given extra requirements need to be fulfilled,
which adapt BRSKI {{RFC8995, Section 5.9.3}}:

* Proof of possession is provided typically by using the specified PKCS #10
  structure in the request.
  Together with Full PKI requests, also CRMF can be used.

* Proof of identity needs to be achieved by signing the certification request
  object using the Full PKI Request option (including the /fullcmc endpoint).
  This provides sufficient information for the RA to authenticate the pledge
  as the origin of the request and to make an authorization decision on the
  received certification request.
  Note:
  EST references CMC {{RFC5272}} for the definition of the Full PKI Request.
  For proof of identity, the signature of the SignedData of the Full PKI Request
  is performed using the IDevID secret of the pledge.  The data signed
  must include include a sufficiently strong identifier of the pledge,
  e.g, the subject of its IDevID certificate.

  Note:
  In this case the binding to the underlying TLS channel is not necessary.

* When the RA is temporarily not available, as per {{RFC7030, Section 4.2.3}},
  an HTTP status code 202 should be returned by the registrar,
  and the pledge will repeat the initial Full PKI Request later.
-->

<!--
Note that the work in the ACE WG described in
{{draft-selander-ace-coap-est-oscore}} may be considered here as well,
as it also addresses the encapsulation of EST in a way that
makes it independent of the underlying TLS channel using OSCORE,
which also entails that authenticated self-contained objects are used.

<strong>Reference:</strong> [THISRFC]</t>

</section>
<section anchor="sec-consider"><name>Security Considerations</name>

<t>The security considerations  laid out in BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/> apply for the
discovery and voucher exchange as well as for the status exchange information.</t>

<t>In particular,
even if the registrar delegates part or all of its RA role
during certificate enrollment to a separate system,
it still must be made sure that the registrar takes part in the decision
on accepting or declining a request to join the domain,
as required in <xref section="5.3" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/>.
As this pertains also to obtaining a valid domain-specific certificate,
it must be made sure that a pledge cannot circumvent the registrar
in the decision whether it is granted an LDevID certificate by the CA.
There are various ways how to fulfill this, including:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>implicit consent</t>
  <t>the registrar signals its consent to the RA out-of-band before or during
the enrollment phase, for instance by entering the pledge identity in a database.</t>
  <t>the registrar provides its consent using an extra message that is transferred
on the same channel as the enrollment messages, possibly in a TLS tunnel.</t>
  <t>the registrar explicitly states its consent by signing, in addition to the pledge,
the authenticated self-contained certificate enrollment request message.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Note: If EST was used, the registrar could give implicit consent on a
certification request by forwarding the request to a PKI entity using a
connection authenticated with a certificate containing an id-kp-cmcRA extension.</t>

<t>When CMP is used, the security considerations laid out in the
LCMPP <xref target="RFC9483"/> apply.</t>

<t>Note that CMP messages are not encrypted.
This may give eavesdroppers insight on which devices are bootstrapped into the
domain, and this in turn might also be used to selectively block the enrollment
of certain devices.
To prevent this, the underlying message transport channel can be encrypted,
for instance by employing TLS.
On the link between the pledge and the registrar this is easily achieved by
reusing the existing TLS channel between them.</t>

      <t>This document specifies automated bootstrapping of an Autonomic Control Plane. To do this, a Secure Key Infrastructure is bootstrapped. This is done using manufacturer-installed X.509 certificates, in combination with a manufacturer's authorizing service, both online and offline. We call this process the Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI) protocol. Bootstrapping a new device can occur when using a routable address and a cloud service, only link-local connectivity, or limited/disconnected networks. Support for deployment models with less stringent security requirements is included. Bootstrapping is complete when the cryptographic identity of the new key infrastructure is successfully deployed to the device. The established secure connection can be used to deploy a locally issued certificate to the device as well.</t>

      <abstract>
	 <t>   This document defines the Constrained Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key
   Infrastructure (Constrained BRSKI) protocol, which provides a
   solution for secure zero-touch bootstrapping of resource-constrained
   (IoT) devices into the network of a domain owner.  This protocol is
   designed for constrained networks, which may have limited data
   throughput or may experience frequent packet loss.  Constrained BRSKI
   is a variant of the BRSKI protocol, which uses an artifact signed by
   the device manufacturer called the &quot;voucher&quot; which enables a new
   device and the owner&#x27;s network to mutually authenticate.  While the
   BRSKI voucher is typically encoded in JSON, Constrained BRSKI uses a
   compact CBOR-encoded voucher.  The BRSKI voucher definition is
   extended with new data types that allow for smaller voucher sizes.
   The Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) protocol, used in BRSKI,
   is replaced with EST-over-CoAPS; and HTTPS used in BRSKI is replaced
   with DTLS-secured CoAP (CoAPS).  This document Updates RFC 8366 and
   RFC 8995.

    <abstract>
      <t>Autonomic functions need a control plane to communicate, which depends on some addressing and routing. This Autonomic Control Plane should ideally be self-managing and be as independent as possible of configuration. This document defines such a plane and calls it the "Autonomic Control Plane", with the primary use as a control plane for autonomic functions. It also serves as a "virtual out-of-band channel" for Operations, Administration, and Management (OAM) communications over a network that provides automatically configured, hop-by-hop authenticated and encrypted communications via automatically configured IPv6 even when the network is not configured or is misconfigured.</t>

      <t>Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) is used as a certificate provisioning protocol over HTTPS. Low-resource devices often use the lightweight Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) for message exchanges. This document defines how to transport EST payloads over secure CoAP (EST-coaps), which allows constrained devices to use existing EST functionality for provisioning certificates.</t>

<section anchor="app-examples"><name>Application Examples</name>

<t>This informative annex provides some detail to
the application examples listed in <xref target="list-examples"/>.</t>

<section anchor="rolling-stock"><name>Rolling Stock</name>

<t>Rolling stock or railroad cars contain a variety of sensors,
actuators, and controllers, which communicate within the railroad car
but also exchange information between railroad cars forming a train,
with track-side equipment, and/or possibly with backend systems.
These devices are typically unaware of backend system connectivity.
Enrolling certificates may be done during maintenance cycles
of the railroad car, but can already be prepared during operation.
Such asynchronous enrollment will include generating certification requests,
which are collected and later forwarded for processing whenever
the railroad car gets connectivity with the backend PKI of the operator.
The authorization of the certification request is then done based on
the operator's asset/inventory information in the backend.</t>

<t>UNISIG has included a CMP profile for enrollment of TLS client and
server X.509 certificates of on-board and track-side components
in the Subset-137 specifying the ETRAM/ETCS
online key management for train control systems <xref target="UNISIG-Subset-137"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="building-automation"><name>Building Automation</name>

<t>In building automation scenarios, a detached
building or the basement of a building may be equipped with sensors, actuators,
and controllers that are connected with each other in a local network but
with only limited or no connectivity to a central building management system.
This problem may occur during installation time but also during operation.
In such a situation a service technician collects the necessary data
and transfers it between the local network and the central building management
system, e.g., using a laptop or a mobile phone.
This data may comprise parameters and settings
required in the operational phase of the sensors/actuators, like a
component certificate issued by the operator to authenticate against other
components and services.</t>

<t>The collected data may be provided by a domain registrar
already existing in the local network. In this case
connectivity to the backend PKI may be facilitated by the service
technician's laptop.
Alternatively, the data can also be collected from the
pledges directly and provided to a domain registrar deployed in a
different network as preparation for the operational phase.
In this case, connectivity to the domain registrar
may also be facilitated by the service technician's laptop.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="substation-automation"><name>Substation Automation</name>

<t>In electrical substation automation scenarios, a control center typically hosts
PKI services to issue certificates for Intelligent Electronic Devices operated
in a substation. Communication between the substation and control center
is performed through a proxy/gateway/DMZ, which terminates protocol flows.
Note that <xref target="NERC-CIP-005-5"/> requires inspection of protocols
at the boundary of a security perimeter (the substation in this case).
In addition, security management in substation automation assumes
central support of several enrollment protocols in order to support
the various capabilities of IEDs from different vendors.
The IEC standard IEC62351-9 <xref target="IEC-62351-9"/>
specifies for the infrastructure side mandatory support of
two enrollment protocols: SCEP <xref target="RFC8894"/> and EST <xref target="RFC7030"/>,
while an Intelligent Electronic Device may support only one of them.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure"><name>Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure</name>

<t>For electric vehicle charging infrastructure, protocols have been
defined for the interaction between the electric vehicle and the
charging point (e.g., ISO 15118-2 <xref target="ISO-IEC-15118-2"/>)
as well as between the charging point and the charging point operator
(e.g. OCPP <xref target="OCPP"/>). Depending on the authentication
model, unilateral or mutual authentication is required. In both cases
the charging point uses an X.509 certificate to authenticate itself
in TLS channels between the electric vehicle and
the charging point. The management of this certificate depends,
among others, on the selected backend connectivity protocol.
In the case of OCPP, this protocol is meant to be the only communication
protocol between the charging point and the backend, carrying all
information to control the charging operations and maintain the
charging point itself. This means that the certificate management
needs to be handled in-band of OCPP. This requires the ability to
encapsulate the certificate management messages in a transport-independent way.
Authenticated self-containment will support this by
allowing the transport without a separate enrollment protocol,
binding the messages to the identity of the communicating endpoints.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="infrastructure-isolation"><name>Infrastructure Isolation Policy</name>

<t>This refers to any case in which network infrastructure is normally
isolated from the Internet as a matter of policy, most likely for
security reasons. In such a case, limited access to external PKI
services will be allowed in carefully controlled short periods of
time, for example when a batch of new devices is deployed, and
forbidden or prevented at other times.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="sites-with-insufficient-level-of-operational-security"><name>Sites with Insufficient Level of Operational Security</name>

<t>The RA performing (at least part of) the authorization of a
certification request is a critical PKI component and therefore requires higher
operational security than components utilizing the issued
certificates for their security features. CAs may also demand higher
security in the registration procedures from RAs, which domain registrars
with co-located RAs may not be able to fulfill.
Especially the CA/Browser forum currently increases the security requirements
in the certificate issuance procedures for publicly trusted certificates,
i.e., those placed in trust stores of browsers,
which may be used to connect with devices in the domain.
In case the on-site components of the target domain cannot be operated securely
enough for the needs of an RA, this service should be transferred to
an off-site backend component that has a sufficient level of security.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Update of examples, specifically for building automation as
well as two new application use cases in <xref target="app-examples"/>.</t>
  <t>Deletion of asynchronous interaction with MASA to not
complicate the use case. Note that the voucher exchange can
already be handled in an asynchronous manner and is therefore
not considered further. This resulted in removal of the
alternative path the MASA in Figure 1 and the associated
description in <xref target="architecture"/>.</t>
  <t>Enhancement of description of architecture elements and
changes to BRSKI in <xref target="architecture"/>.</t>
  <t>Consideration of existing enrollment protocols in the context
of mapping the requirements to existing solutions in <xref target="req-sol"/>.</t>
  <t>New section starting <xref target="exist_prot"/> with the
mapping to existing enrollment protocols by collecting
boundary conditions.</t>
