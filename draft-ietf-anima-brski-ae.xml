<?line 158?>

<t>This document defines enhancements to the Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key
Infrastructure (BRSKI) protocol, known as BRSKI-AE (Alternative Enrollment).<br />
BRSKI-AE extends BRSKI to support certificate enrollment mechanisms
instead of the originally specified use of EST.
It supports certificate enrollment protocols, such as CMP,
that use authenticated self-contained signed objects for certification messages,
allowing for flexibility in network device onboarding scenarios.<br />
The enhancements address use cases where the existing enrollment mechanism
may not be feasible or optimal, providing a framework
for integrating suitable alternative enrollment protocols.<br />
This document also updates the BRSKI reference architecture
to accommodate these alternative methods,
ensuring secure and scalable deployment across a range of network environments.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/> is typically used with Enrollment over Secure Transport
(EST, <xref target="RFC7030"/>) as the enrollment protocol
for operator-specific device certificates, employing HTTP over TLS for secure message transfer.
BRSKI-AE is a variant using alternative enrollment protocols with
authenticated self-contained objects for the device certificate enrollment.
<!--
This enhancement of BRSKI is named BRSKI-AE, where AE stands for
**A**lternative **E**nrollment.
(while originally it was used to abbreviate **A**synchronous **E**nrollment)
--></t>

<t>This approach offers several distinct advantages.
It allows for the authentication of the origin of requests and responses
independently of message transfer mechanisms.
This capability facilitates end-to-end authentication
(i.e., end-to-end proof of origin) across multiple hops
and supports the asynchronous operation of certificate enrollment. Consequently,
this provides architectural flexibility in determining the location and timing
for the ultimate authentication and authorization of certification requests,
while ensuring that the integrity and authenticity of the enrollment messages
is maintained with full cryptographic strength.</t>

<t>This specification carries over the main characteristics of BRSKI, namely:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The pledge is assumed to have received its Initial Device IDentifier
(IDevID, <xref target="IEEE_802.1AR-2018"/>) credentials during its manufacturing.
It uses them to authenticate itself to the
Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority (MASA, <xref target="RFC8995"/>),
and to the registrar, which is the access point of the target domain,
and to possibly further components of the domain where it will be operated.</t>
  <t>The pledge first obtains via the voucher <xref target="RFC8366"/> exchange a trust anchor
for authenticating entities in the domain such as the domain registrar.</t>
  <t>The pledge then obtains its
Locally significant Device IDentifier (IDevID, <xref target="IEEE_802.1AR-2018"/>).
To this end, the pledge generates a private key, called LDevID secret,
and requests via the domain registrar from the PKI of its new domain
a domain-specific device certificate, called LDevID certificate.
On success, it receives the LDevID certificate along with its certificate chain.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The objectives of BRSKI-AE are to enhance BRSKI by enabling LDevID certificate
enrollment through the use of an alternative protocol to EST that:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Supports end-to-end authentication over multiple hops.</t>
  <t>Facilitates secure message exchange over any type of transfer mechanism,
including asynchronous delivery.</t>
</list></t>

<!--- not really: and
* defining a certificate waiting indication and handling, for the case that the
  certifying component is (temporarily) not available.
-->

<t>It may be observed that the BRSKI voucher exchange between the pledge,
registrar, and MASA involves the use of authenticated self-contained objects,
which inherently possess these properties.</t>

<t>The existing well-known URI structure used for BRSKI and EST messages
is extended by introducing an additional path element
that specifies the enrollment protocol being employed.</t>

<t>This specification allows the registrar to offer multiple enrollment protocols,
enabling pledges and their developers to select the most appropriate one
based on the defined overall approach and specific endpoints.</t>

<t>It may be important to note that BRSKI (RFC 8995) specifies the use of
HTTP over TLS, but variations such as Constrained BRSKI
<xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-constrained-voucher"/> which uses CoAP over DTLS,
are possible as well. In this context,
'HTTP' and 'TLS' are used as references to the most common implementation,
though variants using CoAP and/or DTLS are implied where applicable,
as the distinctions are not pertinent here.</t>

<t>This specification, together with its referenced documents, is sufficient to
support BRSKI with the Certificate Management Protocol (CMP, <xref target="RFC9480"/>)
as profiled in the Lightweight CMP Profile (LCMPP, <xref target="RFC9483"/>).
Integrating BRSKI with an enrollment protocol or profile other than LCMPP
will necessitate additional IANA registrations, as detailed in this document.
Furthermore, additional specifications may be required for the details
of the protocol or profile, which fall outside the scope of this document.</t>

<section anchor="sup-env"><name>Supported Scenarios</name>

<t>BRSKI-AE is designed for use in scenarios such as the following:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Pledges and/or the target domain leverage an existing
certificate enrollment protocol other than EST, such as CMP.</t>
  <t>The application context precludes the use of EST
for certificate enrollment due to factors such as:  <list style="symbols">
      <t>The Registration Authority (RA) is not co-located with the registrar
and requires end-to-end authentication of requesters,
which EST does not support over multiple hops.</t>
      <t>The RA or Certification Authority (CA) operator mandates
auditable proof of origin for Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs), which
cannot be provided by TLS as it only offers transient source authentication.</t>
      <t>Certificates are requested for key types, such as Key Encapsulation
Mechanism (KEM) keys, that do not support signing or other
single-shot proof-of-possession methods, as those described in <xref target="RFC6955"/>.
EST, which relies on CSRs in PKCS #10 <xref target="RFC2986"/> format, does not accommodate
these key types because it necessitates proof-of-possession methods
that operate within a single message, whereas proof of possession
for KEM keys requires prior receipt of a fresh challenge value.</t>
      <t>The pledge implementation employs security libraries that do not support EST
or uses a TLS library lacking support for the "tls-unique" value <xref target="RFC5929"/>,
which EST requires for the strong binding of source authentication.</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>Full RA functionality is not available on-site within the target domain,
and connectivity to an off-site RA may be intermittent or entirely offline.
<!-- in the latter case a message store-and-forward mechanism is needed. --></t>
  <t>Authoritative actions by a local RA at the registrar are insufficient
for fully and reliably authorizing pledge certification requests,
potentially due to a lack of access to necessary data or
inadequate security measures, such as the local storage of private keys.
<!-- Final authorization then is done by a RA residing in the backend. --></t>
</list></t>

<t>Bootstrapping may be managed in various ways depending on the application domain.
<xref target="app-examples"/> provides illustrative examples
from different industrial control system environments and operational contexts
that motivate the support of alternative enrollment protocols.</t>

<section anchor="req-sol"><name>Basic Requirements and Mapping to Solutions</name>

<t>Based on the intended target scenarios described in <xref target="sup-env"/> and
the application examples described in <xref target="app-examples"/>, the following
requirements are derived to support authenticated self-contained objects
as containers carrying certification requests.</t>

<t>The following properties are required for a certification request:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Proof of possession: demonstrates access to the private
key corresponding to the public key contained in a certification request.
This is typically achieved by a self-signature using the corresponding
private key but can also be achieved indirectly, see <xref section="4.3" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC4210"/>.</t>
  <t>Proof of identity, also called proof of origin:
provides data origin authentication of the certification request.
Typically, this is achieved by a signature using the pledge IDevID secret
over some data, which needs to include a sufficiently strong identifier
of the pledge, such as the device serial number
typically included in the subject of the IDevID certificate.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The remainder of this section gives a non-exhaustive list of solution examples,
based on existing technology described in IETF documents.</t>

<section anchor="solutions-PoP"><name>Solution Options for Proof of Possession</name>

<t>Certificate signing request (CSR) objects: CSRs are
  data structures protecting only the integrity of the contained data
  and providing proof of possession for a (locally generated) private key.
  Important types of CSR data structures are:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>PKCS #10 <xref target="RFC2986"/>. This very common form of CSR is
self-signed to protect its integrity and to prove possession of
the private key that corresponds to the public key included in the request.</t>
  <t>Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF, <xref target="RFC4211"/>).
This less common but more general CSR format
supports several ways of integrity protection and proof of possession.
Typically a self-signature is used, which is generated over (part of) the
structure with the private key corresponding to the included public key.
CRMF also supports further proof-of-possession methods for types of keys
that do not have signing capability. For details see <xref section="4" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC4211"/>.</t>
</list></t>

<t>It should be noted that the integrity protection of CSRs includes the public key
  because it is part of the data signed by the corresponding private key.
  Yet this signature does not provide data origin authentication, i.e.,
  proof of identity of the requester because the key pair involved is new
  and therefore does not yet have a confirmed identity associated with it.
  <!-- already covered by the next paragraph:
  This extra property can be
  achieved by an additional binding to the IDevID of the pledge.
  This binding to the source authentication supports the
  authorization decision of the certification request.
  --></t>

</section>
<section anchor="solutions-PoI"><name>Solution Options for Proof of Identity</name>

<t>Binding a certificate signing request (CSR) to an existing authenticated
  credential (the BRSKI context, the IDevID certificate) enables
  proof of origin, which in turn supports an authorization decision on the CSR.</t>

<t>The binding of data origin authentication to the CSR
  is typically delegated to the protocol used for certificate management.
  This binding may be achieved through security options in an
  underlying transport protocol such as TLS if the authorization of the
  certification request is (sufficiently) done at the next communication hop.
  Depending on the key type, the binding can also be done in a stronger,
  transport-independent way by wrapping the CSR with a signature.</t>

<t>This requirement is addressed by existing enrollment protocols
  in various ways, such as:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>EST <xref target="RFC7030"/>, also its variant EST-coaps <xref target="RFC9148"/>,
utilizes PKCS #10 to encode Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs).
While such a CSR has not been designed
to include proof of origin, there is a limited, indirect way of
binding it to the source authentication of the underlying TLS session.
This is achieved by including in the CSR the tls-unique value <xref target="RFC5929"/>
resulting from the TLS handshake.  As this is optionally supported
by the EST <spanx style="verb">"/simpleenroll"</spanx> endpoint used in BRSKI
and the TLS handshake employed in BRSKI includes certificate-based client
authentication of the pledge with its IDevID credentials, the proof of
pledge identity being an authenticated TLS client can be bound to the CSR.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Yet this binding is only valid in the context of the TLS session
established with the registrar acting as the EST server and typically also
as an RA.  So even such a cryptographic binding of the authenticated
pledge identity to the CSR is not visible nor verifiable to authorization
points outside the registrar, such as a (second) RA in the backend.
What the registrar needs to do is to authenticate and pre-authorize
the pledge and to indicate this to the (second) RA
by signing the forwarded certification request with its private key and
a related certificate that has the id-kp-cmcRA extended key usage attribute.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
<xref section="2.5" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC7030"/> sketches wrapping PKCS #10-formatted CSRs
with a Full PKI Request message sent to the <spanx style="verb">"/fullcmc"</spanx> endpoint.
This would allow for source authentication at the message level, such that
the registrar could forward it to external RAs in a meaningful way.
This approach is so far not sufficiently described
and likely has not been implemented.</t>
</list></t>

<!--
Note that, besides the existing enrollment protocols, there is
ongoing work in the ACE WG to define an encapsulation of EST messages
in OSCORE, which will result in a TLS-independent way of protecting EST.
This approach {{draft.selander-ace-coap-est-oscore}}
may be considered as a further variant.
-->

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>SCEP <xref target="RFC8894"/> supports using a shared secret (passphrase) or
an existing certificate to protect CSRs based on
SCEP Secure Message Objects using CMS wrapping
(<xref target="RFC5652"/>). Note that the wrapping using
an existing IDevID in SCEP is referred to as 'renewal'.
This way
SCEP does not rely on the security of the underlying message transfer.</t>
  <t>CMP <xref target="RFC4210"/> <xref target="RFC9480"/> supports using a shared secret (passphrase)
or an existing
certificate, which may be an IDevID credential, to authenticate
certification requests via the PKIProtection structure in a PKIMessage.
The certification request is typically encoded utilizing CRMF,
while PKCS #10 is supported as an alternative.
Thus, CMP does not rely on the security of the underlying message transfer.</t>
  <t>CMC <xref target="RFC5272"/> also supports utilizing a shared secret (passphrase) or
an existing certificate to protect certification requests,
which can be either in CRMF or PKCS #10 structure.
The proof of identity can be provided as part of a FullCMCRequest,
based on CMS <xref target="RFC5652"/> and signed with an existing IDevID secret.
Thus, CMC does not rely on the security of the underlying message transfer.</t>
</list></t>

<t>To sum up, EST does not meet the requirements for authenticated self-contained
objects, but SCEP, CMP, and CMC do. This document primarily focuses on CMP as
it has more industry adoption than CMC and SCEP has issues not detailed here.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="uc1"><name>Adaptations to BRSKI</name>

<t>To enable using alternative certificate enrollment protocols supporting end-to-end
authentication, asynchronous enrollment, and more general system architectures,
BRSKI-AE provides some generalizations on BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
This way, authenticated self-contained objects such as those described in
<xref target="req-sol"/> above can be used for certificate enrollment,
and RA functionality can be deployed freely in the target domain.
Parts of the RA functionality can even be distributed over several nodes.</t>

<t>The enhancements are kept to a minimum to ensure
the reuse of already defined architecture elements and interactions.
In general, the communication follows the BRSKI model and utilizes the existing
BRSKI architecture elements.
In particular, the pledge initiates communication with the domain registrar and
interacts with the MASA as usual for voucher request and response processing.</t>

<section anchor="architecture"><name>Architecture</name>

<t>The key element of BRSKI-AE is that the authorization of a certification request
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be performed based on an authenticated self-contained object.
The certification request is bound in a self-contained way
to a proof of origin based on the IDevID credentials.
Consequently, the certification request <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be transferred using any mechanism
or protocol. Authentication and authorization of the certification request
can be done by the domain registrar and/or by backend domain components.
As mentioned in <xref target="sup-env"/>, these components may be offline or off-site.
The registrar and other on-site domain components
may have no or only temporary (intermittent) connectivity to them.</t>

<t>This leads to generalizations in the
placement and enhancements of the logical elements as shown in <xref target="uc1figure"/>.</t>

<t>The architecture overview in <xref target="uc1figure"/>
has the same logical elements as BRSKI, but with a more flexible placement
of the authentication and authorization checks on certification requests.
Depending on the application scenario, the registrar <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> still do all of these
checks (as is the case in BRSKI), or part of them.</t>

<t>The following list describes the on-site components in the target domain
of the pledge shown in <xref target="uc1figure"/>.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Join Proxy: same requirements as in BRSKI, see <xref section="4" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/></t>
  <t>Domain Registrar including LRA or RA functionality: in BRSKI-AE,
the domain registrar has mostly the same functionality as in BRSKI, namely
to act as the gatekeeper of the domain for onboarding new devices and
to facilitate the communication of pledges with their MASA and the domain PKI.
Yet there are some generalizations and specific requirements:  <list style="numbers">
      <t>The registrar <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support at least one certificate enrollment protocol
with authenticated self-contained objects for certification requests.
To this end, the URI scheme for addressing endpoints at the registrar
is generalized (see <xref target="addressing"/>).</t>
      <t>Rather than having full RA functionality, the registrar <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> act as
a local registration authority (LRA) and delegate part of its involvement
in certificate enrollment to a backend RA.
In such scenarios, the registrar optionally checks certification requests
it receives from pledges and forwards them to the backend RA, which performs
the remaining parts of the enrollment request validation and authorization.
Note that to this end the backend RA may need information regarding
the authorization of pledges from the registrar or from other sources.
On the way back, the registrar forwards responses by the PKI
to the pledge on the same channel.      <vspace blankLines='1'/>
To support end-to-end authentication of the pledge across the
registrar to the backend RA, the certification request signed by
the pledge needs to be upheld and forwarded by the registrar.
Therefore, the registrar cannot use for its communication with the PKI
an enrollment protocol that is different from
the enrollment protocol used between the pledge and the registrar.</t>
      <t>The use of a certificate enrollment protocol with
authenticated self-contained objects gives freedom how to transfer
enrollment messages between the pledge and an RA.
BRSKI demands that the RA accept  certification requests for LDevIDs
only with the consent of the registrar.
BRSKI-AE guarantees this also in case that the RA is not part of
the registrar, even if the message exchange with backend systems is unprotected
and involves further transport hops.
See <xref target="sec-consider"/> for details on how this can be achieved.</t>
    </list></t>
</list></t>

<!-- is already covered by paragraph a little further below:
     Note:
     As far as (at least part of) the certificate enrollment traffic is routed
     via the registrar, BRSKI-AE re-uses during the certificate enrollment phase
     the channel that has been established in the BRSKI steps before between the
     pledge and the registrar.  Consequently, tunneling via this channel needs
     to be supported by the certificate enrollment protocol.
     By default, this channel is based on HTTP over TLS,
     but it may also be based on, for instance, CoAP over DTLS
     in the context of Constrained BRSKI {{I-D.ietf-anima-constrained-voucher}}.
-->
<!--
     In the latter scenario,
     the EST-specific parts of that specification do not apply.
-->

<t>Despite the above generalizations to the enrollment phase, the final
step of BRSKI, namely the enrollment status telemetry, is kept as it is.</t>

<t>The following list describes the components provided by
the vendor or manufacturer outside the target domain.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>MASA: functionality as described in BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
The voucher exchange with the MASA via the domain registrar
is performed as described in BRSKI.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Note: From the definition of the interaction with the MASA in
<xref section="5" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/> follows that it may be synchronous (using voucher
request with nonces) or asynchronous (using nonceless voucher requests).</t>
  <t>Ownership tracker: as defined in BRSKI.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The following list describes backend target domain components,
which may be located on-site or off-site in the target domain.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>RA: performs centralized certificate management functions
as a public-key infrastructure for the domain operator.
As far as not already done by the domain registrar, it performs the final
validation and authorization of certification requests.  Otherwise,
the RA co-located with the domain registrar directly connects to the CA.</t>
  <t>CA, also called domain CA: generates domain-specific certificates
according to certification requests that have been
authenticated and authorized by the registrar and/or an extra RA.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Based on the diagram in BRSKI <xref section="2.1" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/> and the architectural
changes, the original protocol flow is divided into several phases
showing commonalities and differences to the original approach as follows.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Discovery phase: mostly as in BRSKI step (1). For details see <xref target="discovery"/>.</t>
  <t>Identification phase: same as in BRSKI step (2).</t>
  <t>Voucher exchange phase: same as in BRSKI steps (3) and (4).</t>
  <t>Voucher status telemetry: same as in BRSKI directly after step (4).</t>
  <t>Certificate enrollment phase: the use of EST in step (5) is changed
to employing a certificate enrollment protocol that uses
an authenticated self-contained object for requesting the LDevID certificate.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
For transporting the certificate enrollment request and response messages, the   (D)TLS channel established between pledge and registrar is <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> to use.
To this end, the enrollment protocol, the pledge, and the registrar need to support the use of this existing channel for certificate enrollment.
Due to this architecture, the pledge does not need to establish additional connections for certificate enrollment and the registrar retains full control over the certificate enrollment traffic.</t>
  <t>Enrollment status telemetry: the final exchange of BRSKI step (5).</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="message_ex"><name>Message Exchange</name>

<t>The behavior of a pledge described in BRSKI <xref section="2.1" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/>
is kept, with one major exception.
After finishing the Imprint step (4), the Enroll step (5) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be performed
with an enrollment protocol utilizing authenticated self-contained objects,
as explained in <xref target="req-sol"/>.
<!--
the certification request MUST be performed using an
authenticated self-contained object providing not only proof of possession
but also proof of identity (source authentication).
-->
<xref target="exist_prot"/> discusses selected suitable enrollment protocols
and options applicable.</t>

<t>An abstract overview of the BRSKI-AE protocol
can be found at <xref target="BRSKI-AE-overview"/>.</t>

<section anchor="discovery"><name>Pledge - Registrar Discovery</name>

<t>Discovery as specified in BRSKI <xref section="4" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/> does not support
the discovery of registrars with enhanced feature sets.
A pledge can not find out in this way whether discovered registrars
support the certificate enrollment protocol it expects, such as CMP.</t>

<t>As a more general solution, the BRSKI discovery mechanism can be extended
to provide up-front information on the capabilities of registrars.
Future work such as <xref target="draft-ietf-anima-brski-discovery"/> may provide this.</t>

<t>In the absence of such a generally applicable solution,
BRSKI-AE deployments may use their particular way of doing discovery.
<xref target="brski-cmp-instance"/> defines a minimalist approach that <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used for CMP.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="pledge-registrar-masa-voucher-exchange"><name>Pledge - Registrar - MASA Voucher Exchange</name>

<t>The voucher exchange is performed as specified in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="pledge-registrar-masa-voucher-status-telemetry"><name>Pledge - Registrar - MASA Voucher Status Telemetry</name>

<t>The voucher status telemetry is performed
as specified in <xref section="5.7" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="pledge-registrar-raca-certificate-enrollment"><name>Pledge - Registrar - RA/CA Certificate Enrollment</name>

<t>This replaces the EST integration for PKI bootstrapping described in
<xref section="5.9" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/>
(while <xref section="5.9.4" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/> remains as the final phase, see below).</t>

<t>The certificate enrollment phase may involve the transmission of several messages.
Details can depend on the application scenario,
the employed enrollment protocol, and other factors.
<!-- <br>
In line with the generalizations described in {{architecture}},
It is RECOMMENDED to transfer these messages
via the channel established between the pledge and the registrar.
--></t>

<t>The only message exchange <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> is for
the actual certification request and response.
Further message exchanges <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be performed as needed.</t>

<t>Note:
The message exchanges marked <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> in the below <xref target="enrollfigure"/>
cover all those supported by the use of EST in BRSKI.
The last <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> one, namely certificate confirmation,
is not supported by EST, but by CMP and other enrollment protocols.</t>

<t>It may be noted that connections between the registrar and the PKI components
of the operator (RA, CA, etc.) may be intermittent or off-line.
Messages should be sent as soon as sufficient transfer capacity is available.</t>

<t>The label <spanx style="verb">[OPTIONAL forwarding]</spanx> in <xref target="enrollfigure"/>
means that on receiving from a pledge a request message of the given type,
the registrar <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> answer the request directly.
In this case, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> authenticate its responses with the same credentials
as used for authenticating itself at the TLS level for the voucher exchange.
Otherwise, the registrar <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> forward the request to the RA
and forward any resulting response back to the pledge.</t>

<t>The decision of whether to forward a request or to answer it directly can depend
on various static and dynamic factors. They include the application scenario,
the capabilities of the registrar and of the local RA possibly co-located
with the registrar, the enrollment protocol being used, and the specific
contents of the request.</t>

<t>Note that
there are several options for how the registrar could be able to directly answer
requests for CA certificates or for certification request attributes.
It could cache responses obtained from the domain PKI and
later use their contents for responding to requests asking for the same data.
The contents could also be explicitly provisioned at the registrar.</t>

<t>Further note that
certification requests typically need to be handled by the backend PKI,
but the registrar can answer them directly with an error response
in case it determines that such a request should be rejected,
for instance, because is not properly authenticated or not authorized.<!--br-->
Also, certificate confirmation messages
will usually be forwarded to the backend PKI,
but if the registrar knows that they are not needed or wanted there
it can acknowledge such messages directly.</t>

<t>The following list provides an abstract description of the flow
depicted in <xref target="enrollfigure"/>.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>CA Certs Request (1): The pledge optionally requests the latest relevant
CA certificates. This ensures that the pledge has the
complete set of current CA certificates beyond the
pinned-domain-cert (which is contained in the voucher
and which may be just the domain registrar certificate).</t>
  <t>CA Certs Response (2): This <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain any intermediate CA certificates
that the pledge may need to validate certificates
and <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> contain the LDevID trust anchor.</t>
  <t>Attribute Request (3): Typically, the automated bootstrapping occurs
without local administrative configuration of the pledge.
Nevertheless, there are cases in which the pledge may also
include in the Certification Request (5) additional attributes that are
specific to the target domain. To get these attributes in
advance, the attribute request may be used.</t>
  <t>Attribute Response (4): This <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain the attributes requested in (3)
to be included in the subsequent Certification Request (5).  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
For example, <xref section="6.11.7.2" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8994"/> specifies
how the attribute request is used to signal to the pledge
the acp-node-name field required for enrollment into an ACP domain.</t>
  <t>Certification Request (5): This <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain the
authenticated self-contained object ensuring both the proof of possession of
the corresponding private key and the proof of identity of the requester.</t>
  <t>Certification Response (6): This <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain on success
the requested certificate and <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> include further information,
like certificates of intermediate CAs and any additional trust anchors.</t>
  <t>Certificate Confirm (7): An optional confirmation sent
after the requested certificate has been received and validated.
If sent, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain a positive or negative confirmation by the pledge to
the PKI whether the certificate was successfully enrolled and fits its needs.</t>
  <t>PKI/Registrar Confirm (8): An acknowledgment by the PKI
that <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be sent on reception of the Certificate Confirm.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The generic messages described above may be implemented using any certificate
enrollment protocol that supports authenticated self-contained objects for the
certification request as described in <xref target="req-sol"/>.
Examples are available in <xref target="exist_prot"/>.</t>

<t>Note that the optional certificate confirmation by the pledge to the PKI
described above is independent of the mandatory enrollment status telemetry
done between the pledge and the registrar in the final phase of BRSKI-AE,
described next.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="pledge-registrar-enrollment-status-telemetry"><name>Pledge - Registrar Enrollment Status Telemetry</name>

<t>The enrollment status telemetry is performed
as specified in <xref section="5.9.4" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/>.</t>

<t>In BRSKI this is described as part of the certificate enrollment step, but
due to the generalization on the enrollment protocol described in this document
it is regarded as a separate phase here.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="addressing"><name>Enhancements to the Endpoint Addressing Scheme of BRSKI</name>

<t>BRSKI-AE extends the addressing scheme outlined in <xref section="5" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/>,
to support alternative enrollment protocols that utilize authenticated,
self-contained objects for certification requests -- see also <xref target="exist_prot"/>).
These extensions are designed to be compatible with existing Registration
Authorities (RAs) and Certification Authorities (CAs) that already support such
enrollment protocols, enabling their use without requiring any modifications.</t>

<t>The addressing scheme in BRSKI for certification requests and
the related CA certificates and CSR attributes retrieval functions
uses the definition from EST <xref target="RFC7030"/>.
Here is the example of simple enrollment: <spanx style="verb">"/.well-known/est/simpleenroll"</spanx>.
This approach is generalized to the following notation:
<spanx style="verb">"/.well-known/&lt;enrollment-protocol&gt;/&lt;request&gt;"</spanx>
in which <spanx style="verb">&lt;enrollment-protocol&gt;</spanx> refers to a certificate enrollment protocol.
Note that enrollment is considered here a message sequence
that contains at least a certification request and a certification response.
The following conventions are used to provide maximal compatibility with BRSKI:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t><spanx style="verb">&lt;enrollment-protocol&gt;</spanx>: <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reference the protocol being used.
Existing values include '<spanx style="verb">est</spanx>' <xref target="RFC7030"/> as in BRSKI and '<spanx style="verb">cmp</spanx>' as in
<xref target="RFC9483"/> and <xref target="brski-cmp-instance"/> below.
Values for other existing protocols such as CMC and SCEP,
as well as for newly defined protocols are outside the scope of this document.
For use of the <spanx style="verb">&lt;enrollment-protocol&gt;</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">&lt;request&gt;</spanx> URI components,
they would need to be specified in a suitable RFC and
placed into the Well-Known URIs registry, just as EST in <xref target="RFC7030"/>.</t>
  <t><spanx style="verb">&lt;request&gt;</spanx>: if present, this path component <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> describe,
depending on the enrollment protocol being used, the operation requested.
Enrollment protocols are expected to define their request endpoints,
as done by existing protocols (see also <xref target="exist_prot"/>).</t>
</list></t>

<!-- ## Domain Registrar Support of Alternative Enrollment Protocols -->

<t>Well-known URIs for various endpoints on the domain registrar are
already defined as part of the base BRSKI specification or indirectly by EST.
In addition, alternative enrollment endpoints <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be supported by the registrar.</t>

<t>A pledge <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use the endpoints defined for the enrollment protocol(s)
that it can use.
It will recognize whether the protocol it uses and the specific request it wants
to perform are understood and supported by the domain registrar
by sending the request to the respective endpoint according to the above
addressing scheme and then evaluating the HTTP status code of the response.
If the pledge uses endpoints that are not standardized,
it risks that the registrar does not recognize a request and thus may reject it,
even if the registrar supports the intended protocol and operation.</t>

<t>The following list of endpoints provides an illustrative example of
a domain registrar supporting several options for EST as well as for
CMP to be used in BRSKI-AE. The listing contains the supported
endpoints to which the pledge may connect for bootstrapping. This
includes the voucher handling as well as the enrollment endpoints.
The CMP-related enrollment endpoints are defined as well-known URIs
in CMP Updates <xref target="RFC9480"/> and the Lightweight CMP Profile <xref target="RFC9483"/>.</t>

<section anchor="exist_prot"><name>Instantiation with Existing Enrollment Protocols</name>

<t>This section maps the generic requirements to support proof of possession
and proof of identity to selected existing certificate enrollment protocols
and specifies further aspects of using such enrollment protocols in BRSKI-AE.</t>

<section anchor="brski-cmp-instance"><name>BRSKI-CMP: BRSKI-AE instantiated with CMP</name>

<t>In this document, references to CMP follow the Lightweight CMP Profile (LCMPP)
<xref target="RFC9483"/> rather than <xref target="RFC4210"/> and <xref target="RFC9480"/>, as the subset of CMP
defined in LCMPP sufficiently meets the required functionality.</t>

<t>Adherence to the LCMPP <xref target="RFC9483"></xref> is <bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14> when using CMP.
The following specific requirements apply (refer to <xref target="enrollfigure"/>):</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The validation of server response messages performed by the CMP client
within the pledge <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be based on the trust anchor established beforehand
via the BRSKI voucher, i.e., on the pinned-domain-cert.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Note that the integrity and authenticity checks on the RA/CA
by the CMP client can be stronger than for EST because
they do not need to be performed hop-by-hop, but are usually end-to-end.</t>
  <t>CA Certs Request (1) and Response (2):<br />
Requesting CA certificates is <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14>.<br />
If supported, it <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be implemented as specified in
<xref section="4.3.1" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC9483"/>.</t>
  <t>Attribute Request (3) and Response (4):<br />
Requesting certification request attributes is <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14>.<br />
If supported, it <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be implemented as specified in
<xref section="4.3.3" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC9483"/>.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Alternatively, the registrar <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> modify
the requested certificate contents
as specified in <xref section="5.2.3.2" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC9483"/>.</t>
  <t>Certification Request (5) and Response (6):<br />
Certificates <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be requested and provided

while retaining the original certification request
with the proof of origin provided by the pledge's signature.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
If additional trust anchors, beyond the pinned-domain-cert,
need to be conveyed to the pledge,
this <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be done in the <spanx style="verb">caPubs</spanx> field of the certification response

enrollment status telemetry with the registrar at the BRSKI level
will be performed as described in <xref section="5.9.4" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/>.</t>
  <t>If delayed delivery of CMP messages is needed
(e.g., to support enrollment over an asynchronous channel),
it <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be performed as specified in

</list></t>

<t>The mechanisms for exchanging messages between the registrar and backend PKI
components (i.e., RA and/or CA) are outside the scope of this document.
CMP's independence from the message transfer mechanism allows for flexibility
in choosing the appropriate exchange method based on the application scenario.
For the applicable security and privacy considerations,
refer to <xref target="sec-consider"/> and <xref target="priv-consider"/>.
Further guidance can be found in <xref section="6" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC9483"/>.</t>

<!--
CMP Updates {{RFC9480}} and
the LCMPP {{RFC9483}}
provide requirements for interoperability.
-->

<t>BRSKI-AE with CMP can also be combined with
Constrained BRSKI <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-constrained-voucher"/>,
using CoAP for enrollment message transport as described by
CoAP Transport for CMP <xref target="RFC9482"/>.
In such scenarios, the EST-specific parts
of <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-constrained-voucher"/> do not apply.</t>

<t>For BRSKI-AE scenarios where a general solution for discovering registrars
with CMP support is not available (cf. <xref target="discovery"/>),
the following minimalist approach <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be used:
perform discovery as defined in BRSKI <xref section="B" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/>, but use
the service name <spanx style="verb">"brski-reg-cmp"</spanx> (as defined in <xref target="iana-consider"/>)
instead of <spanx style="verb">"brski-registrar"</spanx> (as defined in <xref section="8.6" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/>).
Note that this approach does not support join proxies.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="support-of-other-enrollment-protocols"><name>Support of Other Enrollment Protocols</name>

<t>Further instantiations of BRSKI-AE can be done.  They are left for future work.</t>

<t>In particular, CMC <xref target="RFC5272"/> (using its in-band source authentication options)
and SCEP <xref target="RFC8894"/> (using its 'renewal' option) could be used.</t>

<t>The fullCMC variant of EST sketched in <xref section="2.5" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC7030"/>
might also be used here. For EST-fullCMC further specification is necessary.
<!--
Yet most likely it will not be followed up
because, by now, no implementations of this EST variant are known,
and no reasons are known why it could be preferable over using BRSKI-CMP.

<!--
 ## BRSKI-EST-fullCMC: Application to EST

When using EST {{RFC7030}}, the following aspects and constraints
need to be considered and the given extra requirements need to be fulfilled,
which adapt BRSKI {{RFC8995, Section 5.9.3}}:

* Proof of possession is provided typically by using the specified PKCS #10
  structure in the request.
  Together with Full PKI requests, also CRMF can be used.

* Proof of identity needs to be achieved by signing the certification request
  object using the Full PKI Request option (including the /fullcmc endpoint).
  This provides sufficient information for the RA to authenticate the pledge
  as the origin of the request and to make an authorization decision on the
  received certification request.
  Note:
  EST references CMC {{RFC5272}} for the definition of the Full PKI Request.
  For proof of identity, the signature of the SignedData of the Full PKI Request
  is performed using the IDevID secret of the pledge.  The data signed
  must include include a sufficiently strong identifier of the pledge,
  e.g, the subject of its IDevID certificate.

  Note:
  In this case the binding to the underlying TLS channel is not necessary.

* When the RA is temporarily not available, as per {{RFC7030, Section 4.2.3}},
  an HTTP status code 202 should be returned by the registrar,
  and the pledge will repeat the initial Full PKI Request later.
-->

<!--
Note that the work in the ACE WG described in
{{draft-selander-ace-coap-est-oscore}} may be considered here as well,
as it also addresses the encapsulation of EST in a way that
makes it independent of the underlying TLS channel using OSCORE,
which also entails that authenticated self-contained objects are used.

<strong>Description:</strong> Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure registrar with
CMP capabilities according to the Lightweight CMP Profile (LCMPP, <xref target="RFC9483"/>)<br />
<strong>Reference:</strong> [THISRFC]</t>

<t>Note:
We chose here the suffix "cmp" rather than some other abbreviation like "lcmpp"
mainly because this document defines the normative CMP instantiation of
BRSKI-AE, which implies adherence to LCMPP is necessary and sufficient.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="sec-consider"><name>Security Considerations</name>

<t>The security considerations laid out in BRSKI <xref section="11" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/> apply to the
discovery and voucher exchange as well as for the status exchange information.</t>

<t>In particular,
even if the registrar delegates part or all of its RA role
during certificate enrollment to a separate system,
it still must be made sure that the registrar takes part in the decision
on accepting or declining a request to join the domain,
as required in <xref section="5.3" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/>.
As this pertains also to obtaining a valid domain-specific certificate,
it must be made sure that a pledge can not circumvent the registrar
in the decision of whether it is granted an LDevID certificate by the CA.
There are various ways how to fulfill this, including:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>implicit consent</t>
  <t>the registrar signals its consent to the RA out-of-band before or during
the enrollment phase, for instance by entering the pledge identity in a database.</t>
  <t>the registrar provides its consent using an extra message that is transferred
on the same channel as the enrollment messages, possibly in a TLS tunnel.</t>
  <t>the registrar explicitly states its consent by signing, in addition to the pledge,
the authenticated self-contained certificate enrollment request message.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Note: If EST was used, the registrar could give implicit consent on a
certification request by forwarding the request to a PKI entity using a
connection authenticated with a certificate containing an id-kp-cmcRA extension.</t>

<t>When CMP is used, the security considerations laid out in the
LCMPP <xref target="RFC9483"/> apply.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="priv-consider"><name>Privacy Considerations</name>

<t>The privacy considerations laid out in BRSKI <xref section="10" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/> apply as well.</t>

<t>Note that CMP messages themselves are not encrypted.
This may give eavesdroppers insight into which devices are bootstrapped into the
domain.
This in turn might also be used to selectively block the enrollment
of certain devices.</t>

<t>To prevent such issues, the underlying message transport channel can be encrypted.
This is already provided by TLS between the pledge and the registrar, and
for the onward exchange with backend systems, encryption may need to be added.</t>

      <t>This document specifies automated bootstrapping of an Autonomic Control Plane. To do this, a Secure Key Infrastructure is bootstrapped. This is done using manufacturer-installed X.509 certificates, in combination with a manufacturer's authorizing service, both online and offline. We call this process the Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI) protocol. Bootstrapping a new device can occur when using a routable address and a cloud service, only link-local connectivity, or limited/disconnected networks. Support for deployment models with less stringent security requirements is included. Bootstrapping is complete when the cryptographic identity of the new key infrastructure is successfully deployed to the device. The established secure connection can be used to deploy a locally issued certificate to the device as well.</t>

      <abstract>
	 <t>   This document defines the Constrained Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key
   Infrastructure (cBRSKI) protocol, which provides a solution for
   secure zero-touch onboarding of resource-constrained (IoT) devices
   into the network of a domain owner.  This protocol is designed for
   constrained networks, which may have limited data throughput or may
   experience frequent packet loss. cBRSKI is a variant of the BRSKI
   protocol, which uses an artifact signed by the device manufacturer
   called the &quot;voucher&quot; which enables a new device and the owner&#x27;s
   network to mutually authenticate.  While the BRSKI voucher data is
   encoded in JSON, cBRSKI uses a compact CBOR-encoded voucher.  The
   BRSKI voucher data definition is extended with new data types that
   allow for smaller voucher sizes.  The Enrollment over Secure
   Transport (EST) protocol, used in BRSKI, is replaced with EST-over-
   CoAPS; and HTTPS used in BRSKI is replaced with DTLS-secured CoAP
   (CoAPS).  This document Updates RFC 8995 and RFC 9148.

      <t>This document defines a strategy to securely assign a pledge to an owner using an artifact signed, directly or indirectly, by the pledge's manufacturer. This artifact is known as a "voucher".</t>
      <t>This document defines an artifact format as a YANG-defined JSON document that has been signed using a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) structure. Other YANG-derived formats are possible. The voucher artifact is normally generated by the pledge's manufacturer (i.e., the Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority (MASA)).</t>
      <t>This document only defines the voucher artifact, leaving it to other documents to describe specialized protocols for accessing it.</t>

It also serves as a "virtual out-of-band channel" for Operations, Administration, and Management (OAM) communications over a network that provides automatically configured, hop-by-hop authenticated and encrypted communications via automatically configured IPv6 even when the network is not configured or is misconfigured.</t>

<section anchor="app-examples"><name>Application Examples</name>

<t>This informative annex provides some detail about application examples.</t>

<section anchor="rolling-stock"><name>Rolling Stock</name>

<t>Rolling stock or railroad cars contain a variety of sensors,
actuators, and controllers, which communicate within the railroad car
but also exchange information between railroad cars forming a train,
with track-side equipment, and/or possibly with backend systems.
These devices are typically unaware of backend system connectivity.
Enrolling certificates may be done during maintenance cycles
of the railroad car, but can already be prepared during operation.
Such asynchronous enrollment will include generating certification requests,
which are collected and later forwarded for processing whenever
the railroad car gets connectivity with the backend PKI of the operator.
The authorization of the certification request is then done based on
the operator's asset/inventory information in the backend.</t>

<t>UNISIG has included a CMP profile for the enrollment of TLS client and
server X.509 certificates of on-board and track-side components
in the Subset-137 specifying the ETRAM/ETCS
online key management for train control systems <xref target="UNISIG-Subset-137"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="building-automation"><name>Building Automation</name>

<t>In building automation scenarios, a detached
building or the basement of a building may be equipped with sensors, actuators,
and controllers that are connected to each other in a local network but
with only limited or no connectivity to a central building management system.
This problem may occur during installation time but also during operation.
In such a situation a service technician collects the necessary data
and transfers it between the local network and the central building management
system, e.g., using a laptop or a mobile phone.
This data may comprise parameters and settings
required in the operational phase of the sensors/actuators, like a
component certificate issued by the operator to authenticate against other
components and services.</t>

<t>The collected data may be provided by a domain registrar
already existing in the local network. In this case
connectivity to the backend PKI may be facilitated by the service
technician's laptop.
Alternatively, the data can also be collected from the
pledges directly and provided to a domain registrar deployed in a
different network in preparation for the operational phase.
In this case, connectivity to the domain registrar
may also be facilitated by the service technician's laptop.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="substation-automation"><name>Substation Automation</name>

<t>In electrical substation automation scenarios, a control center typically hosts
PKI services to issue certificates for Intelligent Electronic Devices operated
in a substation. Communication between the substation and control center
is performed through a proxy/gateway/DMZ, which terminates protocol flows.
Note that <xref target="NERC-CIP-005-5"/> requires inspection of protocols
at the boundary of a security perimeter (the substation in this case).
In addition, security management in substation automation assumes
central support of several enrollment protocols to support
the various capabilities of IEDs from different vendors.
The IEC standard IEC62351-9 <xref target="IEC-62351-9"/>
specifies for the infrastructure side mandatory support of
two enrollment protocols: SCEP <xref target="RFC8894"/> and EST <xref target="RFC7030"/>,
while an Intelligent Electronic Device may support only one of them.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure"><name>Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure</name>

<t>For electric vehicle charging infrastructure, protocols have been
defined for the interaction between the electric vehicle and the
charging point (e.g., ISO 15118-2 <xref target="ISO-IEC-15118-2"/>)
as well as between the charging point and the charging point operator
(e.g. OCPP <xref target="OCPP"/>). Depending on the authentication
model, unilateral or mutual authentication is required. In both cases,
the charging point uses an X.509 certificate to authenticate itself
in TLS channels between the electric vehicle and
the charging point. The management of this certificate depends,
among others, on the selected backend connectivity protocol.
In the case of OCPP, this protocol is meant to be the only communication
protocol between the charging point and the backend, carrying all
information to control the charging operations and maintain the
charging point itself. This means that the certificate management
needs to be handled in-band of OCPP. This requires the ability to
encapsulate the certificate management messages in a transport-independent way.
Authenticated self-containment will support this by
allowing the transport without a separate enrollment protocol,
binding the messages to the identity of the communicating endpoints.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="infrastructure-isolation"><name>Infrastructure Isolation Policy</name>

<t>This refers to any case in which network infrastructure is normally
isolated from the Internet as a matter of policy, most likely for
security reasons. In such a case, limited access to external PKI
services will be allowed in carefully controlled short periods of
time, for example when a batch of new devices is deployed, and
forbidden or prevented at other times.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="sites-with-insufficient-level-of-operational-security"><name>Sites with Insufficient Level of Operational Security</name>

<t>The RA performing (at least part of) the authorization of a
certification request is a critical PKI component and therefore requires higher
operational security than components utilizing the issued
certificates for their security features. CAs may also demand higher
security in the registration procedures from RAs, which domain registrars
with co-located RAs may not be able to fulfill.
Especially the CA/Browser forum currently increases the security requirements
in the certificate issuance procedures for publicly trusted certificates,
i.e., those placed in trust stores of browsers,
which may be used to connect with devices in the domain.
In case the on-site components of the target domain can not be operated securely
enough for the needs of an RA, this service should be transferred to
an off-site backend component that has a sufficient level of security.</t>

  <t>Balanced (sub-)sections and their headers</t>
  <t>Added details on CMP instance, now called BRSKI-CMP</t>
</list></t>

<t>From IETF draft 04 -&gt; IETF draft 05:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>David von Oheimb became the editor.</t>
  <t>Streamline wording, consolidate terminology, improve grammar, etc.</t>
  <t>Shift the emphasis towards supporting alternative enrollment protocols.</t>
  <t>Update the title accordingly - preliminary change to be approved.</t>
  <t>Move comments on EST and detailed application examples to informative annex.</t>
  <t>Move the remaining text of section 3 as two new sub-sections of section 1.</t>
</list></t>

<t>From IETF draft 03 -&gt; IETF draft 04:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Moved UC2-related parts defining the pledge in responder mode to a
separate document. This required changes and adaptations in several
sections. Main changes concerned the removal of the subsection for UC2
as well as the removal of the YANG model related text as it is not
applicable in UC1.</t>
  <t>Updated references to the Lightweight CMP Profile (LCMPP).</t>
  <t>Added David von Oheimb as co-author.</t>
</list></t>

<t>From IETF draft 02 -&gt; IETF draft 03:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Housekeeping, deleted open issue regarding YANG voucher-request
in UC2 as voucher-request was enhanced with additional leaf.</t>
  <t>Included open issues in YANG model in UC2 regarding assertion
value agent-proximity and CSR encapsulation using SZTP sub module).</t>
</list></t>

<t>From IETF draft 01 -&gt; IETF draft 02:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Defined call flow and objects for interactions in UC2. Object format
based on draft for JOSE signed voucher artifacts and aligned the
remaining objects with this approach in UC2 .</t>
  <t>Terminology change: issue #2 pledge-agent -&gt; registrar-agent to
better underline agent relation.</t>
  <t>Terminology change: issue #3 PULL/PUSH -&gt; pledge-initiator-mode
and pledge-responder-mode to better address the pledge operation.</t>
  <t>Communication approach between pledge and registrar-agent
changed by removing TLS-PSK (former section TLS establishment)
and associated references to other drafts in favor of relying on
higher layer exchange of signed data objects. These data objects
are included also in the pledge-voucher-request and lead to an
extension of the YANG module for the voucher-request (issue #12).</t>
  <t>Details on trust relationship between registrar-agent and
registrar (issue #4, #5, #9) included in UC2.</t>
  <t>Recommendation regarding short-lived certificates for
registrar-agent authentication towards registrar (issue #7) in
the security considerations.</t>
  <t>Introduction of reference to agent signing certificate using SKID
in agent signed data (issue #11).</t>
  <t>Enhanced objects in exchanges between pledge and registrar-agent
to allow the registrar to verify agent-proximity to the pledge
(issue #1) in UC2.</t>
  <t>Details on trust relationship between registrar-agent and
pledge (issue #5) included in UC2.</t>
  <t>Split of use case 2 call flow into sub sections in UC2.</t>
</list></t>

<t>From IETF draft 00 -&gt; IETF draft 01:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Update of scope in <xref target="sup-env"/> to include in
which the pledge acts as a server. This is one main motivation
for use case 2.</t>
  <t>Rework of use case 2 to consider the
transport between the pledge and the pledge-agent. Addressed is
the TLS channel establishment between the pledge-agent and the
pledge as well as the endpoint definition on the pledge.</t>
  <t>First description of exchanged object types (needs more work)</t>
  <t>Clarification in discovery options for enrollment endpoints at
the domain registrar based on well-known endpoints in <xref target="addressing"/>
do not result in additional /.well-known URIs.
Update of the illustrative example.
Note that the change to /brski for the voucher-related endpoints
has been taken over in the BRSKI main document.</t>
  <t>Updated references.</t>
  <t>Included Thomas Werner as additional author for the document.</t>
</list></t>

<t>From individual version 03 -&gt; IETF draft 00:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Inclusion of discovery options of enrollment endpoints at
the domain registrar based on well-known endpoints in
<xref target="addressing"/> as replacement of section 5.1.3
in the individual draft. This is intended to support both use
cases in the document. An illustrative example is provided.</t>
  <t>Missing details provided for the description and call flow in
pledge-agent use case UC2, e.g. to
accommodate distribution of CA certificates.</t>
  <t>Updated CMP example in <xref target="exist_prot"/> to use
Lightweight CMP instead of CMP, as the draft already provides
the necessary /.well-known endpoints.</t>
  <t>Requirements discussion moved to separate section in
<xref target="req-sol"/>. Shortened description of proof-of-identity binding
and mapping to existing protocols.</t>
  <t>Removal of copied call flows for voucher exchange and registrar
discovery flow from <xref target="RFC8995"/> in <xref target="uc1"/> to avoid doubling or text or
inconsistencies.</t>
  <t>Reworked abstract and introduction to be more crisp regarding
the targeted solution. Several structural changes in the document
to have a better distinction between requirements, use case
description, and solution description as separate sections.
History moved to appendix.</t>
</list></t>

<t>From individual version 02 -&gt; 03:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Update of terminology from self-contained to authenticated
self-contained object to be consistent in the wording and to
underline the protection of the object with an existing
credential. Note that the naming of this object may be discussed.
An alternative name may be attestation object.</t>
  <t>Simplification of the architecture approach for the initial use
case having an off-site PKI.</t>
  <t>Introduction of a new use case utilizing authenticated
self-contain objects to onboard a pledge using a commissioning
tool containing a pledge-agent. This requires additional changes
in the BRSKI call flow sequence and led to changes in the
introduction, the application example,and also in the
related BRSKI-AE call flow.</t>
  <t>Update of provided examples of the addressing approach used in
BRSKI to allow for support of multiple enrollment protocols in
<xref target="addressing"/>.</t>
</list></t>

<t>From individual version 01 -&gt; 02:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Update of introduction text to clearly relate to the usage of
IDevID and LDevID.</t>
  <t>Definition of the addressing approach used in BRSKI to allow for
support of multiple enrollment protocols in <xref target="addressing"/>.  This
section also contains a first
discussion of an optional discovery mechanism to address
situations in which the registrar supports more than one enrollment
approach. Discovery should avoid that the pledge performs a trial
and error of enrollment protocols.</t>
  <t>Update of description of architecture elements and
changes to BRSKI in <xref target="architecture"/>.</t>
  <t>Enhanced consideration of existing enrollment protocols in the
context of mapping the requirements to existing solutions in
<xref target="req-sol"/> and in <xref target="exist_prot"/>.</t>
</list></t>

<t>From individual version 00 -&gt; 01:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Update of examples, specifically for building automation as
well as two new application use cases in <xref target="app-examples"/>.</t>
  <t>Deletion of asynchronous interaction with MASA to not
complicate the use case. Note that the voucher exchange can
already be handled in an asynchronous manner and is therefore
not considered further. This resulted in removal of the
alternative path the MASA in Figure 1 and the associated
description in <xref target="architecture"/>.</t>
  <t>Enhancement of description of architecture elements and
changes to BRSKI in <xref target="architecture"/>.</t>
  <t>Consideration of existing enrollment protocols in the context
of mapping the requirements to existing solutions in <xref target="req-sol"/>.</t>
  <t>New section starting <xref target="exist_prot"/> with the
mapping to existing enrollment protocols by collecting
boundary conditions.</t>
