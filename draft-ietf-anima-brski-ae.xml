<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<section anchor="motivation"><name>Motivation</name>

<t>BRSKI, as defined in <xref target="RFC8995"/>, specifies a solution for
secure automated zero-touch bootstrapping of new devices,
which are given the name <em>pledges</em>, in the domain they should operate with.
This includes the discovery of the registrar representing the target domain,
time synchronization or validation, and the exchange of security information
necessary to establish mutual trust between pledges and the target domain.
As explained in <xref target="terminology"/>, the <em>target domain</em>, or <em>domain</em> for short,
is defined as the set of entities that share a common local trust anchor.</t>

<section anchor="voucher-exchange-for-trust-anchor-establishment"><name>Voucher Exchange for Trust Anchor Establishment</name>

<t>Initially, a pledge has a trust anchor only of its manufacturer, not yet
of any target domain.  In order for the pledge to automatically and securely
obtain trust in a suitable target domain represented by its registrar,
BRSKI uses vouchers as defined in <xref target="RFC8366"></xref>.
A voucher is a cryptographic object issued by
the Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority (MASA) of the pledge manufacturer
to the specific pledge identified by the included device serial number.
It is signed with the credentials of the MASA and
can be validated by the manufacturer trust anchor imprinted with the pledge.
So the pledge can accept the voucher contents, which indicate to the pledge
that it can trust the domain identified by the given certificate.</t>

<t>While RFC 8995 only specifies a single, online set of protocol option to
communicate the voucher between MASA, registrar, and pledge
(BRSKI-EST and BRSKI-MASA, see <xref section="2" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/>),
it also describes the architecture for how the voucher
may be provided in online mode (synchronously) or offline mode (asynchronously).
So for the voucher exchange offline mode is basically supported
because the vouchers are self-contained signed objects,
such that their security does not rely on protection by the underlying transfer.</t>

<t>SZTP <xref target="RFC8572"/> is an example of another protocol where vouchers may be
delivered asynchronously by tools such as portable USB "thumb" drives.
However, SZTP does not do signed voucher requests,
so it does not allow the domain to verify the identity of the device
in the same way, nor does it deploy LDevIDs to the device in the same way.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="enrollment-of-ldevid-certificate"><name>Enrollment of LDevID Certificate</name>

<t>Trust in a pledge by other devices in the target domain is enabled
by enrolling the pledge
with a domain-specific Locally significant Device IDentity (LDevID) certificate.</t>

<t>Recall that for certificate enrollment it is crucial to authenticate the
entity requesting the certificate.  Checking both the identity and the
authorization of the requester is the job of a registration authority (RA).
With BRSKI-EST, there is only one RA instance, co-located with the registrar.</t>

<t>The certification request of the pledge is signed using its IDevID secret.
It can be validated by the target domain (e.g., by the domain registrar)
using the trust anchor of the pledge manufacturer,
which needs to pre-installed in the domain.</t>

<t>For enrolling devices with LDevID certificates, BRSKI specifies
how Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) <xref target="RFC7030"/> can be used.
EST has its specific characteristics, detailed in <xref target="using-est"/>.
In particular, it requires online on-site availability of the RA
for performing the data origin authentication
and final authorization decision on the certification request.
This type of enrollment can be called 'synchronous enrollment'.
EST, BRSKI-EST, and BRSKI-MASA as used in RFC 8995 are tied to a specific
transport, TLS, which may not be suitable for the target use case outlined
by the examples in <xref target="list-examples"/>. Therefore deployments may require
different transport, see Constrained Voucher Artifacts for Bootstrapping
Protocols <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-constrained-voucher"/> and EST-coaps <xref target="RFC9148"/>.</t>

<t>Since EST does not support offline enrollment, it may be preferable
for the reasons given in this section and depending on
application scenarios as outlined in <xref target="list-examples"/> and <xref target="app-examples"/>
to use alternative enrollment protocols such as
the Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) <xref target="RFC4210"/>
profiled in <xref target="I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile"/>
or Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) <xref target="RFC5272"/>.
These protocols are more flexible, and by representing the certification
request messages as authenticated self-contained objects,
they are designed to be independent of the transfer mechanism.</t>

<t>Depending on the application scenario, the required components of an RA
may not be part of the BRSKI registrar. They even may not be available on-site
but rather be provided by remote backend systems.
The RA functionality may also be split into an on-site local RA (LRA)
and a central RA component in the backend, referred to as PKI RA.
For certification authorities (CAs) it is common to be located in the backend.
The registrar or its deployment site may not have an online connection
with these RA/CA components or the connectivity may be intermittent.
This may be due to security requirements for operating the backend systems
or due to deployments where on-site or always-online operation
may be not feasible or too costly.
In such scenarios, the authentication and authorization of certification
requests will not or can not be performed on-site.</t>

<t>In this document, enrollment that is not performed over an online connection
is called 'asynchronous enrollment'.
Asynchronous enrollment means that messages need to be forwarded through
offline methods (e.g., Sneakernet/USB sticks) and/or at some point in time
only part of the communication path is available.
Messages need to be stored,
along with the information needed for authenticating their origin,
in front of an unavailable segment for potentially long time (e.g., days)
before they can be forwarded.
This implies that end-to-end security between the parties involved
can not be provided by an authenticated (and often confidential)
communications channel such as TLS used in EST/BRSKI-EST/BRSKI-MASA.</t>

<t>Application scenarios may also involve network segmentation, which is utilized
in industrial systems to separate domains with different security needs --
see also <xref target="infrastructure-isolation"/>.
Such scenarios lead to similar requirements if the TLS channel
that carries the requester authentication is terminated
before the actual requester authorization is performed.
Thus request messages need to be forwarded on further channels
before the registrar or RA can authorize the certification request.
In order to preserve the requester authentication, authentication information
needs to be retained and ideally bound directly to the certification request.</t>

<t>There are basically two approaches for forwarding certification requests
along with requester authentication information:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The component in the target domain that forwards the certification request,
such as a local RA being part of the registrar, combines
the certification request with the validated identity of the requester
(e,g., its IDevID certificate) and an indication of successful verification of
the proof of possession (of the corresponding private key) in a way
preventing changes to the combined information.
This implies that it must be trusted by the PKI.
When connectivity is available, the trusted component
forwards the certification request together with the requester information
(authentication and proof of possession) for further processing.
This approach offers hop-by-hop security, but not end-to-end security.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
In BRSKI, the EST server, being co-located with the registrar in the domain,
is such a component that needs to be trusted by the backend PKI components.
They must rely on the local pledge authentication result provided by that
component
when performing the final authorization of the certification request.</t>
  <t>A trusted intermediate domain component is not needed when involved
components use authenticated self-contained objects for the enrollment,
directly binding the certification request and the requester authentication
in a cryptographic way.  This approach supports end-to-end security,
without the need to trust in intermediate domain components.
Manipulation of the request and the requester identity information
can be detected during the validation of the self-contained signed object.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Note that with this approach the way in which enrollment requests are
forwarded by the registrar to the backend PKI components does not contribute
to their security and therefore does not need to be addressed here.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Focus of this document is the support of alternative enrollment protocols that
allow the second approach, i.e.,
using authenticated self-contained objects for device certificate enrollment.
This enhancement of BRSKI is named BRSKI-AE, where AE stands for
<strong>A</strong>lternative <strong>E</strong>nrollment and for <strong>A</strong>synchronous <strong>E</strong>nrollment.
This specification carries over the main characteristics of BRSKI,
namely that the pledge obtains trust anchor information
for authenticating the domain registrar and other target domain components
as well as a domain-specific X.509 device certificate (the LDevID certificate)
along with the corresponding private key (the LDevID secret)
and certificate chain.</t>

<t>The goals are to provide an enhancement of BRSKI
using enrollment protocols alternatively to EST that</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>support end-to-end security for LDevID certificate enrollment and</t>
  <t>make it applicable to scenarios involving asynchronous enrollment.</t>
</list></t>

<t>This is achieved by</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>extending the well-known URI approach of BRSKI and EST message
with an additional path element
indicating the enrollment protocol being used, and</t>
  <t>defining a certificate waiting indication and handling, for the case that the
certifying component is (temporarily) not available.</t>
</list></t>

<t>This specification can be applied to
both synchronous and asynchronous enrollment.</t>

<t>As an improvement over BRSKI,
this specification supports offering multiple enrollment protocols
which enables pledges and their developers to pick the preferred one.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="sup-env"><name>Supported Environments</name>

<t>BRSKI-AE is intended to be used in domains that may have limited support of
on-site PKI services and comprises application scenarios like the following.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Scenarios indirectly excluding the use of EST for certificate enrollment,
such as the requirement for end-to-end authentication of the requester
while the RA is not co-located with the registrar.</t>
  <t>Scenarios having implementation restrictions
that speak against using EST for certificate enrollment,
such as the use of a library that does not support EST but CMP.</t>
  <t>Pledges and/or the target domain already having an established
certificate management approach different from EST that shall be reused
(e.g., in brownfield installations where CMP is used).</t>
  <t>No RA being available on site in the target domain.
Connectivity to an off-site PKI RA is intermittent or entirely offline.
A store-and-forward mechanism is used
for communicating with the off-site services.</t>
  <t>Authoritative actions of a local RA being not sufficient
for fully authorizing certification requests by pledges.
Final authorization then is done by a PKI RA residing in the backend.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="list-examples"><name>List of Application Examples</name>

<t>Bootstrapping can be handled in various ways,
depending on the application domains.
The informative <xref target="app-examples"/> provides illustrative examples from
various industrial control system environments and operational setups.
They motivate the support of alternative enrollment protocols,
based on the following examples of operational environments:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Rolling stock</t>
  <t>Building automation</t>
  <t>Electrical substation automation</t>
  <t>Electric vehicle charging infrastructures</t>

</section>
<section anchor="req-sol"><name>Requirements and Mapping to Solutions</name>

<section anchor="basic-reqs"><name>Basic Requirements</name>

<t>There are two main drivers for the definition of BRSKI-AE:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The solution architecture may already use or require
a certificate management protocol other than EST.  Therefore,
this other protocol should be usable for requesting LDevID certificates.</t>
  <t>The domain registrar may not be the (final) point
that authenticates and authorizes certification requests,
and the pledge may not have a direct connection to it.
Therefore, certification requests should be self-contained signed objects.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Based on the intended target environment described in <xref target="sup-env"/> and
the application examples described in <xref target="app-examples"/>, the following
requirements are derived to support authenticated self-contained objects
as containers carrying certification requests.</t>

<t>At least the following properties are required for a certification request:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t><em>Proof of possession</em>: demonstrates access to the private
key corresponding to the public key contained in a certification request.
This is typically achieved by a self-signature
using the corresponding private key.</t>
  <t><em>Proof of identity</em>, also called <em>proof of origin</em>:
provides data origin authentication of the certification request.
Typically this is achieved by a signature using the pledge IDevID secret
over some data, which needs to include a sufficiently strong identifier
of the pledge, such as the device serial number
typically included in the subject of the IDevID certificate.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The rest of this section gives an non-exhaustive list of solution examples,
based on existing technology described in IETF documents:</t>

</section>
<section anchor="solution-options-for-proof-of-possession"><name>Solution Options for Proof of Possession</name>

<t>Certification request objects: Certification requests are
  data structures protecting only the integrity of the contained data
  and providing proof of possession for a (locally generated) private key.
  Examples for certification request data structures are:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>PKCS#10 <xref target="RFC2986"/>. This certification request structure is self-signed to
protect its integrity and to prove possession of the private key
that corresponds to the public key included in the request.</t>
  <t>CRMF <xref target="RFC4211"/>. This certificate request message format also supports
integrity protection and proof of possession,
typically by a self-signature generated over (part of) the structure
with the private key corresponding to the included public key.
CRMF also supports further proof-of-possession methods
for types of keys that do not support any signature algorithm.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The integrity protection of certification request fields includes the public
  key because it is part of the data signed by the corresponding private key.
  Yet note that for the above examples this is not sufficient to provide data
  origin authentication, i.e., proof of identity. This extra property can be
  achieved by an additional binding to the IDevID of the pledge.
  This binding to the source authentication supports the
  authorization decision of the certification request.
  The binding of data
  origin authentication to the certification request may be
  delegated to the protocol used for certificate management.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="solution-options-for-proof-of-identity"><name>Solution Options for Proof of Identity</name>

<t>The certification request should be bound to an existing authenticated
  credential (here, the IDevID certificate) to enable a proof of identity
  and, based on it, an authorization of the certification request.
  The binding may be achieved through security options in an
  underlying transport protocol such as TLS if the authorization of the
  certification request is (completely) done at the next communication hop.
  This binding can also be done in a transport-independent way by wrapping the
  certification request with a signature employing an existing IDevID.
  In the BRSKI context, this will be the IDevID.
  This requirement is addressed by existing enrollment protocols
  in various ways, such as:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>EST <xref target="RFC7030"/> utilizes PKCS#10 to
encode the certification request. The Certificate Signing
Request (CSR) optionally provides a binding to the underlying TLS session
by including the tls-unique value in the self-signed PKCS#10 structure.
The tls-unique value results from the TLS handshake.
Since the TLS handshake includes certificate-based client
authentication and the pledge utilizes its IDevID for it,
the proof of identity is provided by such a binding to the TLS session.
This can be supported using the EST /simpleenroll endpoint.
Note that the binding of the TLS handshake to the CSR is optional in EST.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
<xref section="2.5" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC7030"/> sketches wrapping the CSR with a Full PKI Request
message sent to the /fullcmc endpoint.
This would allow for source authentication
<!-- removed as it is not the only option: using an existing certificate -->
at message level as an alternative to indirectly binding
to the underlying TLS authentication in the transport layer.</t>
  <t>SCEP <xref target="RFC8894"/> supports using a shared secret (passphrase) or
an existing certificate to protect CSRs based on
SCEP Secure Message Objects using CMS wrapping
(<xref target="RFC5652"/>). Note that the wrapping using
an existing IDevID in SCEP is referred to as <em>renewal</em>.
This way
SCEP does not rely on the security of the underlying message transfer.</t>
  <t>CMP <xref target="RFC4210"/> supports using a shared secret (passphrase) or an existing
certificate, which may be an IDevID credential, to authenticate
certification requests via the PKIProtection structure in a PKIMessage.
The certification request is typically encoded utilizing CRMF,
while PKCS#10 is supported as an alternative.
Thus, CMP does not rely on the security of the underlying message transfer.</t>
  <t>CMC <xref target="RFC5272"/> also supports utilizing a shared secret (passphrase) or
an existing certificate to protect certification requests,
which can be either in CRMF or PKCS#10 structure.
The proof of identity can be provided as part of a FullCMCRequest,
based on CMS <xref target="RFC5652"/> and signed with an existing IDevID secret.
Thus
also CMC does not rely on the security of the underlying message transfer.</t>
</list></t>

<!--
Note that, besides the existing enrollment protocols, there is
ongoing work in the ACE WG to define an encapsulation of EST messages in
OSCORE, which will result in a TLS-independent way of protecting EST.
This approach {{I-D.selander-ace-coap-est-oscore}}
may be considered as a further variant.

<section anchor="uc1"><name>Adaptations to BRSKI</name>

<t>In order to support alternative certificate enrollment protocols,
asynchronous enrollment, and more general system architectures,
BRSKI-AE provides some generalizations on BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
This way, authenticated self-contained objects such as those described in
<xref target="req-sol"/> above can be used for certificate enrollment,
and RA functionality can be distributed freely in the target domain.</t>

<t>The enhancements needed are kept to a minimum in order to ensure reuse of
already defined architecture elements and interactions.
In general, the communication follows the BRSKI model and utilizes the existing
BRSKI architecture elements.
In particular, the pledge initiates communication with the domain registrar and
interacts with the MASA as usual for voucher request and response processing.</t>

<section anchor="architecture"><name>Architecture</name>

<t>The key element of BRSKI-AE is that the authorization of a certification request
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be performed based on an authenticated self-contained object.
The certification request is bound in a self-contained way
to a proof of origin based on the IDevID.
Consequently, the authentication and authorization of the certification request
<bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be done by the domain registrar and/or by other domain components.
These components may be offline or
reside in some central backend of the domain operator (off-site)
as described in <xref target="sup-env"/>. The registrar and other on-site domain components
may have no or only temporary (intermittent) connectivity to them.
The certification request <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> also be piggybacked on another protocol.</t>

<t>This leads to generalizations in the
placement and enhancements of the logical elements as shown in <xref target="uc1figure"/>.</t>

<t>The architecture overview in <xref target="uc1figure"/>
has the same logical elements as BRSKI, but with more flexible placement
of the authentication and authorization checks on certification requests.
Depending on the application scenario, the registrar <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> still do all of these
checks (as is the case in BRSKI), or part of them, or none of them.</t>

<t>The following list describes the on-site components in the target domain
of the pledge shown in <xref target="uc1figure"/>.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Join Proxy: same functionality as described in BRSKI <xref section="4" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/></t>
  <t>Domain Registrar including RA, LRA, or Enrollment Proxy: in BRSKI-AE,
the domain registrar has mostly the same functionality as in BRSKI, namely
to facilitate the communication of the pledge with the MASA and the PKI.
Yet there are two generalizations:  <list style="numbers">
      <t>The registrar <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> support at least one certificate enrollment protocol
that uses for certificate requests authenticated self-contained objects.
To this end, the URI scheme for addressing the endpoint at the registrar
is generalized (see <xref target="addressing"/>).      <vspace blankLines='1'/>
To support the end-to-end proof of identity of the pledge,
the enrollment protocol used by the pledge
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> also be used by the registrar for its upstream certificate enrollment
message exchange with backend PKI components.
Between the pledge and the registrar the enrollment messages are typically
tunneled over the TLS channel already established between these entities.
The registrar optionally checks the requests and then passes them on to
the PKI. On the way back, it forwards responses by the PKI to the pledge
on the existing TLS channel.</t>
      <t>The registrar <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> also delegate all or part of its certificate enrollment
support to a separate system. That is, alternatively to having full RA
functionality, the registrar may act as a local registration authority
(LRA) or just as an enrollment proxy.
In such cases, the domain registrar may forward the certification request
to some off-site RA component, also called PKI RA here, that performs
the remaining parts of the enrollment request validation and authorization.
This also covers the case that the registrar has only intermittent
connection and forwards certification requests to off-site PKI components
upon re-established connectivity.      <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Still all certificate enrollment traffic goes via the registrar, such that
from the pledge perspective there is no difference in connectivity and
the registrar is involved in all steps.  The final step of BRSKI,
namely the enrollment status telemetry, is also kept.</t>
    </list></t>
</list></t>

<t>The following list describes the components provided by
the vendor or manufacturer outside the target domain.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>MASA: functionality as described in BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
The voucher exchange with the MASA via the domain registrar
is performed as described in BRSKI.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
Note: From the definition of the interaction with the MASA in
<xref section="5" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/> follows that it may be synchronous
(voucher request with nonce) or asynchronous (voucher request without nonce).</t>
  <t>Ownership tracker: as defined in BRSKI.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The following list describes the target domain components that can optionally be
operated in the off-site backend of the target domain.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>PKI RA: Performs certificate management functions for the domain
as a centralized public-key infrastructure for the domain operator.
As far as not already done by the domain registrar, it performs the final
validation and authorization of certification requests.  Otherwise,
the RA co-located with the domain registrar directly connects to the PKI CA.</t>
  <t>PKI CA: Performs certificate generation by signing the certificate structure
requested in already authenticated and authorized certification requests.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Based on the diagram in BRSKI <xref section="2.1" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/> and the architectural
changes, the original protocol flow is divided into four phases
showing commonalities and differences to the original approach as follows.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Discovery phase: same as in BRSKI steps (1) and (2).</t>
  <t>Voucher exchange phase: same as in BRSKI steps (3) and (4).</t>
  <t>Certificate enrollment phase: the use of EST in step (5) is changed
to employing a certificate enrollment protocol that uses
an authenticated self-contained object for requesting the LDevID certificate.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
For transporting the certificate enrollment request and response messages, the
TLS channel established between pledge and registrar is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> to use.
To this end, the enrollment protocol, the pledge, and the registrar
need to support using the TLS channel for certificate enrollment.
Due to this recommended architecture, typically the pledge does not need
to establish additional connections for certificate enrollment and
the registrar retains control over the certificate enrollment traffic.
The registrar <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> forward such messages, and it <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> also redirect the pledge
to use other connections for (part of) certificate enrollment.</t>
  <t>Enrollment status telemetry phase: the final exchange of BRSKI step (5).</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="message_ex"><name>Message Exchange</name>

<t>The behavior of a pledge described in BRSKI <xref section="2.1" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/>
is kept with one exception.
After finishing the Imprint step (4), the Enroll step (5) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be performed
with an enrollment protocol utilizing authenticated self-contained objects.
<!-- Note that EST with simple-enroll cannot be applied here because
it binds the pledge authentication to the transport channel (TLS) rather than
to the certification request object itself, so this form of authentication
is not visible / verifiable to authorization points outside the registrar.-->
<xref target="exist_prot"/> discusses selected suitable enrollment protocols
and options applicable.</t>

<t>An abstract overview of the BRSKI-AE protocol
can be found in <xref target="BRSKI-AE-overview"/>.</t>

<section anchor="pledge-registrar-discovery"><name>Pledge - Registrar Discovery</name>

<t>The discovery is done as specified in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="pledge-registrar-masa-voucher-exchange"><name>Pledge - Registrar - MASA Voucher Exchange</name>

<t>The voucher exchange is performed as specified in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="pledge-registrar-raca-certificate-enrollment"><name>Pledge - Registrar - RA/CA Certificate Enrollment</name>

<t>The certificate enrollment phase may involve several exchanges
of requests and response messages.
Details can depend on the application scenario,
the employed enrollment protocol, and other factors.</t>

<t>The only message exchange required in any case is for the actual certificate
request and response message.  As stated in <xref target="req-sol"/>, the certificate request
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be performed using an authenticated self-contained object providing
not only proof of possession but also proof of identity (source authentication).
This message exchange, as well as any others, is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> to be routed
via the existing TLS channel between the pledge and the registrar.</t>

<t>Which of the message exchanges marked <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> in the below <xref target="enrollfigure"/>
are potentially used, or are actually required or prohibited to be used,
as well as which other other exchanges may occur within the TLS channel
or outside of it, depends on the enrollment protocol.</t>

<t>Note:
The mentioned <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> exchanges cover all those supported by the use of EST
in BRSKI. The last <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> one, namely certificate confirmation,
is not supported by EST, but by CMP and other enrollment protocols.</t>

<t>The various connections between the registrar and the PKI components
of the operator (RA, CA, etc.) may be intermittent or off-line.
Messages are to be sent as soon as sufficient transfer capacity is available.</t>

<t>The label <spanx style="verb">[OPTIONAL forwarding]</spanx> means that on receiving from a pledge a
request of the given type, the registrar <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> answer the request directly itself.
Otherwise the registrar <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> forward the request to a backend PKI component
and forward any resulting response back to the pledge.</t>

<t>Notes:
The decision whether to forward a request or to answer it directly can depend
on various static and dynamic factors. They include the application scenario,
the capabilities of the registrar and of the local RA possibly co-located
with the registrar, the enrollment protocol being used, and the specific
contents of the request.</t>

<t>There are several options how the registrar could be able to directly answer
requests for CA certificates or for certificate request attributes.
It could cache responses obtained from the backend PKI and
later use their contents for responding to requests asking for the same data.
The contents could also be explicit provisioned at the registrar.</t>

<t>Certificate requests typically need to be handled by the backend PKI,
but the registrar can answer them directly with an error response
in case it determines that such a request should be rejected,
for instance because is not properly authenticated or not authorized.</t>

<t>Also certificate confirmation messages
will usually be forwarded to the backend PKI,
but if the registrar knows that they are not needed or wanted there
it can acknowledge such messages directly.</t>

<t>The following list provides an abstract description of the flow
depicted in <xref target="enrollfigure"/>.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>CA Certs Request (1): The pledge optionally requests the latest relevant
CA certificates. This ensures that the pledge has the
complete set of current CA certificates beyond the
pinned-domain-cert (which is contained in the voucher
and may be just the domain registrar certificate).</t>
  <t>CA Certs Response (2): This <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain the current root CA certificate,
which typically is the LDevID trust anchor, and any additional certificates
that the pledge may need to validate certificates.</t>
  <t>Attribute Request (3): Typically, the automated bootstrapping occurs
without local administrative configuration of the pledge.
Nevertheless, there are cases in which the pledge may also
include additional attributes specific to the target domain
into the certification request. To get these attributes in
advance, the attribute request can be used.  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
For example, <xref section="6.11.7.2" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8994"/> specifies
how the attribute request is used to signal to the pledge
the acp-node-name field required for enrollment into an ACP domain.</t>
  <t>Attribute Response (4): This <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain the attributes to be included
in the subsequent certification request.</t>
  <t>Certificate Request (5): This <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain the
authenticated self-contained object ensuring both proof of possession of the
corresponding private key and proof of identity of the requester.</t>
  <t>Certificate Response (6): This <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain on success
the requested certificate and <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> include further information,
like certificates of intermediate CAs.</t>
  <t>Certificate Confirm (7): An optional confirmation sent
after the requested certificate has been received and validated.
It contains a positive or negative confirmation by the pledge to the PKI
whether the certificate was successfully enrolled and fits its needs.</t>
  <t>PKI/Registrar Confirm (8): An acknowledgment by the PKI
that <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be sent on reception of the Cert Confirm.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The generic messages described above may be implemented using any certificate
enrollment protocol that supports authenticated self-contained objects for the
certificate request as described in <xref target="req-sol"/>.
Examples are available in <xref target="exist_prot"/>.</t>

<t>Note that the optional certificate confirmation by the pledge to the PKI
described above is independent of the mandatory enrollment status telemetry
done between the pledge and the registrar in the final phase of BRSKI-AE,
described next.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="pledge-registrar-enrollment-status-telemetry"><name>Pledge - Registrar Enrollment Status Telemetry</name>

<t>The enrollment status telemetry is performed as specified in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.</t>

<t>In BRSKI this is described as part of the enrollment step, but
due to the generalization on the enrollment protocol described in this document
its regarded as a separate phase here.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="addressing"><name>Enhancements to the Endpoint Addressing Scheme of BRSKI</name>

<t>BRSKI-AE provides generalizations to the addressing scheme defined in
BRSKI <xref section="5" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8995"/> to accommodate alternative enrollment protocols
that use authenticated self-contained objects for certification requests.
As this is supported by various existing enrollment protocols,
they can be employed without modifications to existing PKI RAs/CAs
supporting the respective enrollment protocol (see also <xref target="exist_prot"/>).</t>

<t>The addressing scheme in BRSKI for certification requests and
the related CA certificates and CSR attributes retrieval functions
uses the definition from EST <xref target="RFC7030"/>,
here on the example of simple enrollment: <spanx style="verb">"/.well-known/est/simpleenroll"</spanx>.
This approach is generalized to the following notation:
<spanx style="verb">"/.well-known/&lt;enrollment-protocol&gt;/&lt;request&gt;"</spanx>
in which <spanx style="verb">&lt;enrollment-protocol&gt;</spanx> refers to a certificate enrollment protocol.
Note that enrollment is considered here a message sequence
that contains at least a certification request and a certification response.
The following conventions are used to provide maximal compatibility with BRSKI:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t><spanx style="verb">&lt;enrollment-protocol&gt;</spanx>: <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reference the protocol being used.
Existing values include EST <xref target="RFC7030"></xref> as in BRSKI and CMP as in
<xref target="I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile"></xref> and <xref target="brski-cmp-instance"/> below.
Values for other existing protocols such as CMC and SCEP,
or for newly defined protocols, require their own specifications
for their use of the <spanx style="verb">&lt;enrollment-protocol&gt;</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">&lt;request&gt;</spanx> URI components
and are outside the scope of this document.</t>
  <t><spanx style="verb">&lt;request&gt;</spanx>: if present, this path component <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> describe,
depending on the enrollment protocol being used, the operation requested.
Enrollment protocols are expected to define their request endpoints,
as done by existing protocols (see also <xref target="exist_prot"/>).</t>
</list></t>

<!-- ## Domain Registrar Support of Alternative Enrollment Protocols -->

<t>Well-known URIs for various endpoints on the domain registrar are
already defined as part of the base BRSKI specification or indirectly by EST.
In addition, alternative enrollment endpoints <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be supported at the registrar.</t>

<t>A pledge <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use the endpoints defined for the enrollment protocol(s)
that it is capable of.
It will recognize whether its preferred protocol or the request that it tries
to perform is supported by the domain registrar
by sending a request to its preferred enrollment endpoint according to the above
addressing scheme and evaluating the HTTP status code in the response.</t>

<t>The following list of endpoints provides an illustrative example for
a domain registrar supporting several options for EST as well as for
CMP to be used in BRSKI-AE. The listing contains the supported
endpoints to which the pledge may connect for bootstrapping. This
includes the voucher handling as well as the enrollment endpoints.
The CMP-related enrollment endpoints are defined as well-known URIs
in CMP Updates <xref target="I-D.ietf-lamps-cmp-updates"/>
and the Lightweight CMP Profile <xref target="I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile"/>.</t>

<t>The fullCMC variant of EST sketched in <xref section="2.5" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC7030"/>

Yet most likely it will not be followed up

<!--
## BRSKI-EST-fullCMC: Instantiation to EST

When using EST {{RFC7030}}, the following aspects and constraints
need to be considered and the given extra requirements need to be fulfilled,
which adapt BRSKI {{RFC8995, Section 5.9.3}}:

* Proof of possession is provided typically by using the specified PKCS#10
  structure in the request.
  Together with Full PKI requests, also CRMF can be used.

* Proof of identity needs to be achieved by signing the certification request
  object using the Full PKI Request option (including the /fullcmc endpoint).
  This provides sufficient information for the RA to authenticate the pledge
  as the origin of the request and to make an authorization decision on the
  received certification request.
  Note:
  EST references CMC {{RFC5272}} for the definition of the Full PKI Request.
  For proof of identity, the signature of the SignedData of the Full PKI Request
  is performed using the IDevID secret of the pledge.  The data signed
  must include include a sufficiently strong identifier of the pledge,
  e.g, the subject of its IDevID certificate.

  Note: In this case the binding to the underlying TLS channel is not necessary.

* When the RA is temporarily not available, as per {{RFC7030, Section 4.2.3}},
  an HTTP status code 202 should be returned by the registrar,
  and the pledge will repeat the initial Full PKI Request later.
-->

<!--
Note that the work in the ACE WG described in
{{I-D.selander-ace-coap-est-oscore}} may be considered
here as well, as it also addresses the encapsulation of EST in a way to
make it independent of the underlying TLS channel using OSCORE,
which also entails that authenticated self-contained objects are used.

   Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) version 2.  This document
   updates RFC 4210, RFC 5912, and RFC 6712.

   The aspects of CMP updated in this document are using EnvelopedData
   instead of EncryptedValue, clarifying the handling of p10cr messages,
   improving the crypto agility, as well as adding new general message
   types, extended key usages to identify certificates for use with CMP,
   and well-known URI path segments.

   CMP version 3 is introduced to enable signaling support of
   EnvelopedData instead of EncryptedValue and signaling the use of an
   explicit hash AlgorithmIdentifier in certConf messages, as far as
   needed.

      <abstract>
	 <t>   This document defines the Constrained Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key
   Infrastructure (Constrained BRSKI) protocol, which provides a
   solution for secure zero-touch bootstrapping of resource-constrained
   (IoT) devices into the network of a domain owner.  This protocol is
   designed for constrained networks, which may have limited data
   throughput or may experience frequent packet loss.  Constrained BRSKI
   is a variant of the BRSKI protocol, which uses an artifact signed by
   the device manufacturer called the &quot;voucher&quot; which enables a new
   device and the owner&#39;s network to mutually authenticate.  While the
   BRSKI voucher is typically encoded in JSON, Constrained BRSKI defines
   a compact CBOR-encoded voucher.  The BRSKI voucher is extended with
   new data types that allow for smaller voucher sizes.  The Enrollment
   over Secure Transport (EST) protocol, used in BRSKI, is replaced with
   EST-over-CoAPS; and HTTPS used in BRSKI is replaced with CoAPS.

<abstract><t>Autonomic functions need a control plane to communicate, which depends on some addressing and routing.  This Autonomic Control Plane should ideally be self-managing and be as independent as possible of configuration.  This document defines such a plane and calls it the &quot;Autonomic Control Plane&quot;, with the primary use as a control plane for autonomic functions.  It also serves as a &quot;virtual out-of-band channel&quot; for Operations, Administration, and Management (OAM) communications over a network that provides automatically configured, hop-by-hop authenticated and encrypted communications via automatically configured IPv6 even when the network is not configured or is misconfigured.</t></abstract>

<section anchor="using-est"><name>Using EST for Certificate Enrollment</name>

<t>When using EST with BRSKI, pledges interact via TLS with the domain registrar,
which acts both as EST server and as the PKI RA.
The TLS channel is mutually authenticated,
where the pledge uses its IDevID certificate issued by its manufacturer.</t>

<t>Using BRSKI-EST has the advantage that the mutually authenticated TLS
channel established between the pledge and the registrar can be reused
for protecting the message exchange needed for enrolling the LDevID certificate.
This strongly simplifies the implementation of the enrollment message exchange.</t>

<t>Yet the use of TLS has the limitation that this cannot provide auditability
nor end-to-end authentication of the CSR by the pledge at a remote PKI RA/CA
because the TLS session is transient and terminates at the registrar.
This is a problem in particular if the enrollment is done via multiple hops,
part of which may not even be network-based.</t>

<t>With enrollment protocols that use for CSRs self-contained signed objects,
logs of CSRs can be audited because CSRs can be third-party authenticated
in retrospect, whereas TLS connections can not.</t>

<t>Furthermore, the BRSKI registrars in each site have to be hardened so that they
can be trusted to be the TLS initiator of the EST connection to the PKI RA/CA,
and in result, their keying material needs to be managed with more security
care than that of pledges because of trust requirements,
for example they need to have the id-kp-cmcRA extended key usage attribute
according to <xref target="RFC7030"/>, see <xref target="RFC6402"/>.
Impairment to a BRSKI registrar can result in arbitrarily
many fake certificate registrations because real authentication and
authorization checks can then be circumvented.</t>

<t>Relying on TLS authentication of the TLS client, which is supposed to
be the certificate requester, for a strong proof of origin for the CSR
is conceptually non-trivial and can have implementation challenges.
EST has the option to include in the certification request, which is a PKCS#10
CSR, the so-called tls-unique value <xref target="RFC5929"/> of the underlying TLS channel.
This binding of the proof of identity of the TLS client to the proof of
possession for the private key requires specific support by TLS implementations.</t>

<t>The registrar terminates the security association with the pledge at
TLS level and thus the binding between the certification request and
the authentication of the pledge. In BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/>, the registrar
typically doubles as the PKI RA and thus also authenticates the CSR
and filters/denies requests from non-authorized pledges.
If the registrar cannot do the final authorization checks on the CSR and needs
to forward it to the PKI RA, there is no end-to-end proof of identity and thus
the decision of the PKI RA must trust on the pledge authentication performed
by the registrar.  If successfully authorized, the CSR is passed to the PKI CA,
which will issue the domain-specific certificate (LDevID).
If in this setup the protocol between the on-site registrar and the remote PKI
RA is also EST, this approach requires online or at least intermittent
connectivity between registrar and PKI RA, as well as availability of the PKI RA
for performing the final authorization decision on the certification request.</t>

<t>A further limitation of using EST as the certificate enrollment protocol is that
due to using PKCS#10 structures in enrollment requests,
the only possible proof-of-possession method is a self-signature, which
excludes requesting certificates for key types that do not support signing.
CMP, for instance, has special proof-of-possession options for key agreement
and KEM keys, see <xref section="5.2.8" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC4210"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="app-examples"><name>Application Examples</name>

<t>This informative annex provides some detail to
the application examples listed in <xref target="list-examples"/>.</t>

<section anchor="rolling-stock"><name>Rolling Stock</name>

<t>Rolling stock or railroad cars contain a variety of sensors,
actuators, and controllers, which communicate within the railroad car
but also exchange information between railroad cars building a train,
with track-side equipment, and/or possibly with backend systems.
These devices are typically unaware of backend system
connectivity. Managing certificates may be done during maintenance
cycles of the railroad car, but can already be prepared during
operation. Preparation will include generating certification requests,
which are collected and later forwarded for
processing, once the railroad car is connected to the operator backend.
The authorization of the certification request is then done based on
the operator's asset/inventory information in the backend.</t>

<t>UNISIG has included a CMP profile for enrollment of TLS client and
server X.509 certificates of on-board and track-side components
in the Subset-137 specifying the ETRAM/ETCS
on-line key management for train control systems <xref target="UNISIG-Subset-137"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="building-automation"><name>Building Automation</name>

<t>In building automation scenarios, a detached
building or the basement of a building may be equipped with sensors, actuators,
and controllers that are connected with each other in a local network but
with only limited or no connectivity to a central building management system.
This problem may occur during installation time but also during operation.
In such a situation a service technician collects the necessary data
and transfers it between the local network and the central building management
system, e.g., using a laptop or a mobile phone.
This data may comprise parameters and settings
required in the operational phase of the sensors/actuators, like a
component certificate issued by the operator to authenticate against other
components and services.</t>

<t>The collected data may be provided by a domain registrar
already existing in the local network. In this case
connectivity to the backend PKI may be facilitated by the service
technician's laptop.
Alternatively, the data can also be collected from the
pledges directly and provided to a domain registrar deployed in a
different network as preparation for the operational phase.
In this case, connectivity to the domain registrar
may also be facilitated by the service technician's laptop.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="substation-automation"><name>Substation Automation</name>

<t>In electrical substation automation scenarios, a control center typically hosts
PKI services to issue certificates for Intelligent Electronic Devices operated
in a substation. Communication between the substation and control center
is performed through a proxy/gateway/DMZ, which terminates protocol flows.
Note that <xref target="NERC-CIP-005-5"/> requires inspection of protocols
at the boundary of a security perimeter (the substation in this case).
In addition, security management in substation automation assumes
central support of several enrollment protocols in order to support
the various capabilities of IEDs from different vendors.
The IEC standard IEC62351-9 <xref target="IEC-62351-9"/>
specifies for the infrastructure side mandatory support of
two enrollment protocols: SCEP <xref target="RFC8894"/> and EST <xref target="RFC7030"/>,
while an Intelligent Electronic Device may support only one of them.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure"><name>Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure</name>

<t>For electric vehicle charging infrastructure, protocols have been
defined for the interaction between the electric vehicle and the
charging point (e.g., ISO 15118-2 <xref target="ISO-IEC-15118-2"/>)
as well as between the charging point and the charging point operator
(e.g. OCPP <xref target="OCPP"/>). Depending on the authentication
model, unilateral or mutual authentication is required. In both cases
the charging point uses an X.509 certificate to authenticate itself
in TLS channels between the electric vehicle and
the charging point. The management of this certificate depends,
among others, on the selected backend connectivity protocol.
In the case of OCPP, this protocol is meant to be the only communication
protocol between the charging point and the backend, carrying all
information to control the charging operations and maintain the
charging point itself. This means that the certificate management
needs to be handled in-band of OCPP. This requires the ability to
encapsulate the certificate management messages in a transport-independent way.
Authenticated self-containment will support this by
allowing the transport without a separate enrollment protocol,
binding the messages to the identity of the communicating endpoints.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="infrastructure-isolation"><name>Infrastructure Isolation Policy</name>

<t>This refers to any case in which network infrastructure is normally
isolated from the Internet as a matter of policy, most likely for
security reasons. In such a case, limited access to external PKI
services will be allowed in carefully controlled short periods of
time, for example when a batch of new devices is deployed, and
forbidden or prevented at other times.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="sites-with-insufficient-level-of-operational-security"><name>Sites with Insufficient Level of Operational Security</name>

<t>The RA performing (at least part of) the authorization of a
certification request is a critical PKI component and therefore requires higher
operational security than components utilizing the issued
certificates for their security features. CAs may also demand higher
security in the registration procedures from RAs, which domain registrars
with co-located RAs may not be able to fulfill.
Especially the CA/Browser forum currently increases the security requirements
in the certificate issuance procedures for publicly trusted certificates,
i.e., those placed in trust stores of browsers,
which may be used to connect with devices in the domain.
In case the on-site components of the target domain cannot be operated securely
enough for the needs of an RA, this service should be transferred to
an off-site backend component that has a sufficient level of security.</t>
