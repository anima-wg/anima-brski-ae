          BRSKI-AE: Alternative Enrollment Protocols in BRSKI
                 draft-ietf-anima-brski-async-enroll-05

Abstract

   This document enhances Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure
   (BRSKI, [RFC8995]) to support end-to-end security and asynchronous
   operation of certificate enrollment.

   Making BRSKI flexible on the certificate enrollment protocol being
   used, BRSKI-AE allows employing protocols such as CMP, where the
   origin of certificate requests and responses can be authenticated
   independently of message transfer by using self-contained (signature-
   wrapped) objects.

Internet-Draft                  BRSKI-AE                      March 2022


1.  Introduction

   BRSKI, as defined in [RFC8995], specifies a solution for secure
   automated zero-touch bootstrapping of new devices, so-called pledges,
   in an operational domain.  This includes the discovery of the
   registrar in the target domain, time synchronization, and the
   exchange of security information necessary to establish mutual trust
   between pledges and the domain.

   A pledge gains trust in the target domain via the domain registrar as
   follows.  It obtains security information about the domain,
   specifically the target domain certificate to be trusted, by
   requesting a voucher object defined in [RFC8366].  Such a voucher is
   a self-contained signed object originating from a Manufacturer
   Authorized Signing Authority (MASA).  Therefore, the voucher may be
   provided in online mode (synchronously) or offline mode
   (asynchronously).  The pledge can authenticate the voucher because it
   is shipped with a trust anchor of its manufacturer such that it can
   validate signatures (including related certificates) by the MASA.

   Trust by the target domain in a pledge is established by enrolling an
   LDevID certificate of the pledge that is specific to the target
   domain.  The target domain can validate the certification request of
   the pledge based on the trust anchor of the pledge manufacturer,
   which needs to pre-installed in the domain.

   For enrolling devices with LDevID certificates, BRSKI typically
   utilizes Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) [RFC7030].  Using EST
   has its specific characteristics, detailed in Appendix A.  In
   particular, it requires online or on-site availability of the RA for
   performing the final authorization decision on the certification
   request.  This type of enrollment can be called _synchronous
   enrollment_. For various reasons, it may be preferable to use
   alternative enrollment protocols such as the Certificate Management
   Protocol (CMP) [RFC4210] profiled in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile] or Certificate Management
   over CMS (CMC) [RFC5272]. that are more flexible and independent of
   the transfer level because they represent certification requests as
   authenticated self-contained objects.

   Depending on the application scenario, the required RA/CA components
   may not be part of the registrar.  They even may not be available on-
   site but rather be provided by remote backend systems.  The registrar
   or its site may not have an online connection with them or the
   connectivity may be intermittent.  This may be due to security
   requirements for operating the backend systems or due to site
   deployments where on-site or always-online operation may be not
   feasible or too costly.  In such scenarios, the authorization of



von Oheimb, et al.      Expires 5 September 2022                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                  BRSKI-AE                      March 2022


   certification request will not or can not be performed on-site at
   enrollment time.  In this document, enrollment that is not performed
   in a (time-wise) consistent way is called _asynchronous enrollment_.
   Asynchronous enrollment requires a store-and-forward transfer of
   certification requests along with the information needed for
   authenticating the requester.  This allows offline processing the
   request at a later point in time.

   Application scenarios may also involve network segmentation, which is
   utilized in industrial systems to separate domains with different
   security needs.  Such scenarios lead to similar requirements if the
   communication channel carrying the requester authentication is
   terminated and thus request messages need to be forwarded on further
   channels before the registrar/RA can authorize the certification
   request: in order to preserve the requester authentication,
   authentication information needs to be retained and ideally bound
   directly to the certification request.

   There are basically two approaches for forwarding certification
   requests along with requester authentication information:

   *  Having a trusted component (e.g., a local RA) in the target domain
      that stores the certification request combined with the requester
      authentication information (based on the IDevID) and potentially
      the information about successful verification of the proof of
      possession (of the corresponding private key) in a way preventing
      changes to the combined information.  Note that the proof of
      identity and the proof of possession may not have been bound
      cryptographically.  When connectivity is available, the trusted
      component forwards the certification request together with the
      requester information (authentication and proof of possession) for
      further processing.  This approach offers only hop-by-hop
      security: the backend PKI must rely on the local pledge
      authentication result when performing the authorization of the
      certification request.  In BRSKI, the EST server is such a trusted
      component, being co-located with the registrar in the target
      domain.

   *  Utilizing an authenticated self-contained object for the
      enrollment, directly binding the certification request and the
      requester authentication in a cryptographic way.  This approach
      supports end-to-end security, reducing the need to trust in
      intermediate domain components.  Manipulation of the request and
      the requester identity information can be detected during the
      validation of the self-contained object.

Internet-Draft                  BRSKI-AE                      March 2022


   Focus of this document is the support of alternative enrollment
   protocols that allow handling authenticated self-contained objects
   for device credential bootstrapping.  This enhancement of BRSKI is
   named BRSKI-AE, where AE stands for alternative enrollment protocols
   and for asynchronous enrollment.  Like BRSKI, this specification
   results in the pledge storing an X.509 domain certificate with the
   corresponding private key and sufficient information for verifying
   the domain registrar identity (LDevID CA certificate) as well as
   domain-specific X.509 device certificates (LDevID EE certificates).

   The goals are to enhance BRSKI to

   *  support alternative enrollment protocols,

   *  support end-to-end security for enrollment, and

   *  make it applicable to scenarios involving asynchronous enrollment.

   This is achieved by

   *  extending the well-known URI approach with an additional path
      element indicating the enrollment protocol being used, and

   *  defining a certificate waiting indication and handling, for the
      case that the certifying component is (temporarily) not available.

   This specification can be applied to both synchronous and
   asynchronous enrollment.

   In contrast to BRSKI, this specification supports offering multiple
   enrollment protocols on the infrastructure side, which enables
   pledges and their developers to pick the preferred one.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document relies on the terminology defined in [RFC8995].  The
   following terms are defined in addition:

   EE:  End entity, in the BRSKI context called pledge.  It is the






von Oheimb, et al.      Expires 5 September 2022                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                  BRSKI-AE                      March 2022


      entity that is bootstrapped to the target deployment domain.  It
      holds a public-private key pair, for which it requests a public-
      key certificate.  An identifier for the EE is given as the subject
      of the certificate.

   RA:  Registration authority, an optional system component to which a
      CA delegates certificate management functions such as
      authenticating requesters and performing authorization checks.

   CA:  Certification authority, issues certificates.

   on-site:  Describes a component or service or functionality available
      in the target deployment domain.

   off-site:  Describes a component or service or functionality
      available in an operator domain different from the target
      deployment domain.  This may be a central site or a cloud service,
      to which only a temporary connection is available, or which is in
      a different administrative domain.

   asynchronous communication:  Describes a time-wise interrupted
      communication between a pledge (EE) and a registrar or PKI
      component.

   synchronous communication:  Describes a time-wise uninterrupted
      communication between a pledge (EE) and a registrar or PKI
      component.

   authenticated self-contained object:  Describes in this context an
      object that is cryptographically bound to an EE certificate
      (IDevID certificate or LDevID certificate) of a pledge.  The
      binding is assumed to be provided through a digital signature of
      the actual object using the private key corresponding to the EE
      certificate.

3.  Scope of the solution

3.1.  Supported environment

   BRSKI-AE is intended to be used in domains that may have limited
   support of on-site PKI services and comprises application scenarios
   like the following.

   *  There are requirements or implementation restrictions that do not
      allow using EST for enrolling LDevID certificates.

Internet-Draft                  BRSKI-AE                      March 2022


   *  Pledges and/or the target deployment domain already have an
      established certificate management approach different from EST
      that shall be reused (e.g., in brownfield installations).

   *  There is no registration authority available on site in the target
      domain.  Connectivity to an off-site RA is intermittent or
      entirely offline.  A store-and-forward mechanism is used for
      communicating with the off-site services.

   *  Authoritative actions of a local RA are limited and may not be
      sufficient for authorizing certification requests by pledges.
      Final authorization is done by an RA residing in the operator
      domain.

3.2.  List of application examples

   Bootstrapping can be handled in various ways, depending on the
   application domains.  The informative annex Appendix B provides
   illustrative examples from various automation domains and operational
   setups.  They motivate the support of alternative enrollment
   protocols, based on the operational environments in the examples.
   Examples are provided for

   *  Rolling stock

   *  Building automation

   *  Electrical substation automation

   *  Electric vehicle charging infrastructures

   *  Infrastructure isolation policy

   *  Domains with less operational security

4.  Requirements discussion and mapping to solution elements

   For the requirements discussion we assume that the domain registrar
   receiving a certification request as an authenticated object is not
   always the (final) authorization point for this certification
   request.  If the domain registrar is the only authorization point and
   the pledge has a direct connection to it, BRSKI can be used directly.
   Note that BRSKI-AE may still be needed in this case, for instance
   when the pledge prefers a protocol other than EST.

Internet-Draft                  BRSKI-AE                      March 2022


   Based on the intended target environment described in Section 3.1 and
   the application examples described in Appendix B, the following
   requirements are derived to support authenticated self-contained
   objects as container carrying certification requests and further
   information to support asynchronous operation.

   At least the following properties are required:

   *  proof of possession: demonstrates access to the private key
      corresponding to the public key contained in a certification
      request.  This is typically achieved by a self-signature using the
      private key.

   *  proof of identity: provides data origin authentication of a data
      object such as a certificate request.  This typically is achieved
      by a signature using the private key associated with the IDevID
      certificate of the pledge, or, in case of certificate updates,
      with the certificate to be updated.

   Here is an incomplete list of solution examples, based on existing
   technology described in IETF documents:

   *  Certification request objects: Certification requests are data
      structures protecting only the integrity of the contained data and
      providing proof of possession for a (locally generated) private
      key.  Examples for certification request data structures are:

      -  PKCS#10 [RFC2986].  The structure is self-signed to protect its
         integrity and prove possession of the private key that
         corresponds to the included public key of the requester.

      -  CRMF [RFC4211].  Also this structure supports integrity
         protection and proof of possession, typically by a self-
         signature generated over (part of) the structure with the
         private key corresponding to the included public key.  CRMF
         also supports further proof-of-possession methods for types of
         keys that do not support any signature algorithm.

      The integrity protection of certification request fields includes
      the public key because it is part of the data signed by the
      corresponding private key.  Yet note that for the above examples
      this is not sufficient to provide data origin authentication,
      i.e., proof of identity.  This extra property can be achieved by
      an additional binding to the IDevID of the pledge.  This binding
      to source authentication supports the authorization decision for
      the certification request.  The binding of data origin
      authentication to the certification request may be delegated to
      the protocol used for certificate management.

   *  Solution options for proof of identity: The certification request
      should be bound to an existing authenticated credential (here,
      IDevID) to enable a proof of identity and, based on it, an
      authorization of the certification request.  The binding may be
      achieved through security options in an underlying transport
      protocol such as TLS if the authorization of the certification
      request is (completely) done at the next communication hop.  This
      binding can also be done in a transport-independent way by
      wrapping the certification request with signature employing an
      existing credential.  In the BRSKI context, this will be the
      IDevID.  This requirement is addressed by existing enrollment
      protocols in various ways, such as:

      -  EST [RFC7030] utilizes PKCS#10 to encode the certification
         request.  The Certificate Signing Request (CSR) may contain a
         binding to the underlying TLS session by including the tls-
         unique value in the self-signed CSR structure.  The tls-unique
         value results from the TLS handshake.  Since the TLS handshake
         includes client authentication and the pledge utilizes its
         IDevID for it, the proof of identity can be provided by the
         binding to the TLS session.  This is supported in EST using the
         /simpleenroll endpoint.  As an alternative to binding to the
         underlying authentication in the transport layer, [RFC7030]
         sketches wrapping the CSR with a Full PKI Request message using
         an existing certificate.

      -  SCEP [RFC8894] supports using a shared secret (passphrase) or
         an existing certificate to protect CSRs based on SCEP Secure
         Message Objects using CMS wrapping ([RFC5652]).  Note that the
         wrapping using an existing IDevID credential in SCEP is
         referred to as renewal.  Thus SCEP does not rely on the
         security of the underlying transfer.

      -  CMP [RFC4210] supports using a shared secret (passphrase) or an
         existing certificate, which may be an IDevID credential, to
         authenticate certification requests via the PKIProtection
         structure in a PKIMessage.  The certification request is
         typically encoded utilizing CRMF, while PKCS#10 is supported as
         an alternative.  Thus CMP does not rely on the security of the
         underlying transfer.

      -  CMC [RFC5272] also supports utilizing a shared secret
         (passphrase) or an existing certificate to protect
         certification requests, which can be either in CRMF or PKCS#10
         format.  The proof of identity can be provided as part of a
         FullCMCRequest, based on CMS [RFC5652] and signed with an
         existing IDevID credential.  Thus CMC does not rely on the
         security of the underlying transfer.

5.  Adaptations to BRSKI

   In order to support alternative enrollment protocols, asynchronous
   enrollment, and more general system architectures, BRSKI-AE lifts
   some restrictions of BRSKI [RFC8995].  This way, authenticated self-
   contained objects such as those described in Section 4 above can be
   used for certificate enrollment.

   The enhancements needed are kept to a minimum in order to ensure
   reuse of already defined architecture elements and interactions.  In
   general, the communication follows the BRSKI model and utilizes the
   existing BRSKI architecture elements.  In particular, the pledge
   initiates communication with the domain registrar and interacts with
   the MASA as usual.

5.1.  Architecture

   The key element of BRSKI-AE is that the authorization of a
   certification request MUST be performed based on an authenticated
   self-contained object.  The certification request is bound to a proof
   of origin based on the IDevID.  Consequently, the authentication and
   authorization of the certification request MAY be done by the domain
   registrar and/or by other PKI components, which may be offline or
   reside in some central backend of the domain operator (off-site) as
   described in Section 3.1.  The deployment or on-site domain of the
   pledge and registrar may have no or only temporary (intermittent)
   connectivity to them.  The certification request MAY also be
   piggybacked on another protocol.

   This leads to generalizations in the placement and enhancements of
   the logical elements as shown in Figure 1.

            off-site or central "domain" components

       Figure 1: Architecture overview using off-site PKI components

   The architecture overview in Figure 1 has the same logical elements
   as BRSKI, but with more flexible placement of the authentication and
   authorization checks on certification requests.  Depending on the
   application scenario, the registrar MAY still do all of these checks
   (as is the case in BRSKI), or part of them, or none of them.

   The following list describes the components in the deployment target
   domain of the pledge as well as the base services.

   *  Join Proxy: same functionality as described in BRSKI [RFC8995].

Internet-Draft                  BRSKI-AE                      March 2022


   *  Domain Registrar / Enrollment Proxy: in BRSKI-AE, the domain
      registrar has mostly the same functionality as in BRSKI, namely to
      facilitate the communication of the pledge with the MASA and the
      PKI.  Yet there is a difference regarding certificate enrollment,
      detailed below.

   *  Voucher exchange: the voucher exchange with the MASA via the
      domain registrar is performed as described in BRSKI.

   *  Certificate enrollment: in contrast to BRSKI, the domain registrar
      possibly does not fully perform the authorization of certification
      requests.  If at least part of the authorization is done by some
      external RA component, the domain registrar MUST forward the
      certification request to this RA.  To this end, the certification
      request object MUST include a proof of origin such that the
      authorization can be based on the authenticated pledge identity
      information.  The proof of origin SHOULD be done by an additional
      signature using the IDevID.  Hence the domain registrar MAY act as
      a local registration authority (LRA) or simply as an enrollment
      proxy, and it can also handle the situation that it has only
      intermittent connection to an off-site PKI by storing the
      authenticated certification request and forwarding it to the RA
      upon re-established connectivity.

   Since BRSKI uses EST for the certificate enrollment, while BRSKI-AE
   uses authenticated self-contained objects, the definitions of the
   pledge and the domain registrar are modified by allowing the use of
   alternative enrollment protocols and generalizing the scheme for
   addressing the domain registrar (see Section 5.2.5).

   The following list describes the vendor-related components/service
   outside the deployment domain.

   *  MASA: general functionality as described in BRSKI [RFC8995].  Note
      that the interaction with the MASA may be synchronous (voucher
      request with nonce) or asynchronous (voucher request without
      nonce).

   *  Ownership tracker: as defined in BRSKI.

   The following list describes the operator-related components/service
   operated in the off-site backend of the domain.

Internet-Draft                  BRSKI-AE                      March 2022


   *  PKI RA: Performs certificate management functions for the domain
      as a centralized public-key infrastructure for the domain
      operator.  As far as not already done by the domain registrar, it
      performs the final validation and authorization of certification
      requests.  The authorization may require interaction with an asset
      management system, etc.

   *  PKI CA: Performs certificate generation by signing the certificate
      structure requested in already authenticated and authorized
      certification requests.

   Based on BRSKI and the architectural changes, the original protocol
   flow is divided into three phases showing commonalities and
   differences to the original approach as follows.

   *  Discovery phase: same as in BRSKI [RFC8995] steps (1) and (2)

   *  Voucher exchange with deployment domain registrar: same as in
      BRSKI steps (3) and (4).

   *  Enrollment phase: step (5) is changed to using authenticated self-
      contained objects.

5.2.  Message exchange

   The behavior of a pledge as described in [RFC8995] is kept with one
   exception.  After finishing the imprinting phase (4) the enrollment
   phase (5) MUST be performed with a method supporting authenticated
   self-contained objects.  Note that EST with simple-enroll cannot be
   applied here because it binds the pledge authentication to the
   transport channel (TLS) rather than to the certification request
   object itself, so this form of authentication is not visible /
   verifiable to authorization points outside the registrar.  Section 6
   discusses selected suitable enrollment protocols and options
   applicable.

5.2.1.  Pledge - Registrar discovery and voucher exchange

   The discovery phase and voucher exchange is applied as specified in
   [RFC8995].

5.2.2.  Registrar - MASA voucher exchange

   This voucher exchange is performed as specified in [RFC8995].

5.2.3.  Pledge - Registrar - RA/CA certificate enrollment

   As stated in Section 4, the enrollment MUST be performed using an
   authenticated self-contained object providing not only proof of
   possession but also proof of identity (source authentication).

   The following list provides an abstract description of the flow
   depicted in Figure 2.

   *  CA Cert Request: The pledge SHOULD request the latest relevant CA
      Certificates.  This ensures that the pledge has the complete set
      of current CA certificates beyond the pinned-domain-cert (which
      may be the domain registrar certificate contained in the voucher).

   *  CA Cert Response: SHOULD contain at least the CA certificate of
      the issuing CA.

   *  Attribute Request: Typically, the automated bootstrapping occurs
      without local administrative configuration of the pledge.
      Nevertheless, there are cases in which the pledge may also include
      additional attributes specific to the deployment domain into the
      certification request.  To get these attributes in advance, the
      attribute request SHOULD be used.

   *  Attribute Response: SHOULD contain the attributes to be included
      in the subsequent certification request.

   *  Cert Request: This certification request MUST contain the
      authenticated self-contained object ensuring both proof of
      possession of the corresponding private key and proof of identity
      of the requester.

   *  Cert Response: The certification response message MUST contain on
      success the requested certificate and MAY include potentially
      further information, like certificates of intermediary CAs on the
      certification path.

   *  Cert Waiting: Optional waiting indication for the pledge, which
      SHOULD retry after a given time.  For this a request identifier is
      necessary.  This request identifier may be either part of the
      enrollment protocol or can derived from the certification request.

   *  Cert Polling: This SHOULD be used by the pledge to query the
      registrar whether the certification request meanwhile has been
      processed; can be answered either by another Cert Waiting, or a
      Cert Response.

   *  Cert Confirm: positive or negative confirmation message by the
      pledge the SHOULD be sent after receiving and validating a new
      certificate.

   *  PKI/Registrar Confirm: An acknowledgment by the PKI or domain
      registrar that MUST be sent on reception of the Cert Confirm.

   The generic messages described above MAY be implemented using various
   enrollment protocols supporting authenticated self-contained request
   objects, as described in Section 4.  Examples are available in
   Section 6.

5.2.4.  Pledge - Registrar - enrollment status telemetry

   The enrollment status telemetry is performed as specified in
   [RFC8995].  In BRSKI this is described as part of the enrollment
   phase, but due to the generalization on the enrollment protocol
   described in this document it fits better as a separate step here.

5.2.5.  Addressing scheme enhancements

   BRSKI-AE provides generalizations to the addressing scheme defined in
   BRSKI [RFC8995] to accommodate alternative enrollment protocols that
   use authenticated self-contained objects for certification requests.
   As this is supported by various existing enrollment protocols, they
   can be directly employed (see also Section 6).

   The addressing scheme in BRSKI for client certificate request and CA
   certificate distribution function during the enrollment uses the
   definition from EST [RFC7030], here on the example on simple
   enrollment: "/.well-known/est/simpleenroll" This approach is
   generalized to the following notation: "/.well-known/<enrollment-
   protocol>/<request>" in which <enrollment-protocol> can be an already
   existing protocol or a newly defined approach.  Note that enrollment
   is considered here as a sequence of at least a certification request
   and a certification response.  In case of existing enrollment
   protocols the following notation is used proving compatibility to
   BRSKI:

   *  <enrollment-protocol>: MUST reference the protocol being used,
      which MAY be EST [RFC7030] as in BRSKI or CMP, CMC, SCEP, or a
      newly defined approach.  Note: additional endpoints (well-known
      URIs) at the registrar may need to be defined by the utilized
      enrollment protocol.

   *  <request>: depending on the utilized enrollment protocol, the
      <request> path component MUST describe the required operation at
      the registrar side.  Enrollment protocols are expected to define
      their request endpoints, as done by existing protocols (see also
      Section 6).

5.3.  Domain registrar support of alternative enrollment protocols

   Well-known URIs for various endpoints on the domain registrar are
   already defined as part of the base BRSKI specification.  In
   addition, alternative enrollment endpoints MAY be supported at the
   domain registrar.  The pledge will recognize whether its preferred
   enrollment option is supported by the domain registrar by sending a
   request to its preferred enrollment endpoint and evaluating the HTTP
   response status code.

   The following list of endpoints provides an illustrative example for
   a domain registrar supporting several options for EST as well as for
   CMP to be used in BRSKI-AE.  The listing contains the supported
   endpoints to which the pledge may connect for bootstrapping.  This
   includes the voucher handling as well as the enrollment endpoints.
   The CMP related enrollment endpoints are defined as well-known URIs
   in CMP Updates [I-D.ietf-lamps-cmp-updates] and the Lightweight CMP
   profile [I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile].

6.  Examples for signature-wrapping using existing enrollment protocols

   This section maps the requirements to support proof of possession and
   proof of identity to selected existing enrollment protocols.

6.1.  Instantiation to EST (informative)

   When using EST [RFC7030], the following aspects and constraints need
   to be considered and the given extra requirements need to be
   observed:

   *  proof of possession is provided by using the specified PKCS#10
      structure in the request.

   *  proof of identity needs to be achieved by signing the
      certification request object using the Full PKI Request option
      (including the /fullcmc endpoint).  This provides sufficient
      information for the RA to make an authorization decision on the
      received certification request.  Note: EST references CMC
      [RFC5272] for the definition of the Full PKI Request.  For proof
      of identity, the signature of the SignedData of the Full PKI
      Request is performed using the IDevID credential of the pledge.

   *  TBD RFC Editor: please delete /* TBD: in this case the binding to
      the underlying TLS connection is not necessary. */

   *  When the RA is temporarily not available, as per [RFC7030] section
      4.2.3, an HTTP status code 202 should be returned by the
      Registrar.  The pledge in this case will retry a /simpleenroll
      with a PKCS#10 request.  Note that if the TLS connection is taken
      down during the waiting period, the PKCS#10 request needs to be
      rebuilt if it contains the unique identifier (tls_unique) from the
      underlying TLS connection for the binding.

   *  TBD RFC Editor: please delete /* TBD: clarification of retry for
      fullcmc is necessary as not specified in the context of EST */

6.2.  Instantiation to CMP (normative if CMP is chosen)

   Note: Instead of referring to CMP as specified in [RFC4210] and
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-cmp-updates], this document refers to the Lightweight
   CMP Profile [I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile] because the
   subset of CMP defined there is sufficient for the functionality
   needed here.

   When using CMP, the following requirements SHALL be observed:

   *  For proof of possession, the approach defined in the Lightweight
      CMP Profile [I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile] section 4.1.1
      (based on CRMF) or 4.1.4 (based on PCKS#10) SHALL be applied.

Internet-Draft                  BRSKI-AE                      March 2022


   *  proof of identity SHALL be provided by using signature-based
      protection of the certificate request message as outlined in
      section 3.2. of [I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile].

   *  When the RA/CA is not available, a waiting indication SHALL be
      returned in the PKIStatus by the Registrar as specified in
      sections 4.4 and 5.1.2 of [I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile]
      for delayed delivery.

   *  Requesting CA certificates and certificate request attributes
      SHALL be implemented a specified in sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.3 of
      [I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile].

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require IANA actions.

8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations as laid out in BRSKI [RFC8995] apply for
   the discovery and voucher exchange as well as for the status exchange
   information.

   The security considerations as laid out in the Lightweight CMP
   Profile [I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile] apply as far as CMP

Appendix A.  Using EST for certificate enrollment

   When using EST with BRSKI, pledges interact via TLS with the domain
   registrar, which acts both as EST server and as registration
   authority (RA).  The TLS connection is mutually authenticated, where
   the pledge uses its IDevID certificate issued by its manufacturer.

   In order to provide a strong proof of origin of the certificate
   request, EST has the option to include in the certification request
   the so-called tls-unique value [RFC5929] of the underlying TLS
   channel.  This binding of the proof of identity of the TLS client,
   which is supposed to be the certificate requester, to the proof of
   possession for the private key is conceptually non-trivial and
   requires specific support by TLS implementations.

   The registrar terminates the security association with the pledge at
   TLS level and thus the binding between the certification request and
   the authentication of the pledge.  The EST server uses the
   authenticated pledge identity provided by the IDevID for checking the
   authorization of the pledge for the given certification request
   before issuing to the pledge a domain-specific certificate (LDevID
   certificate).  This approach typically requires online or on-site
   availability of the RA for performing the final authorization
   decision for the certification request.

   Using EST for BRSKI has the advantage that the mutually authenticated
   TLS connection established between the pledge and the registrar can
   be reused for protecting the message exchange needed for enrolling
   the LDevID certificate.  This strongly simplifies the implementation
   of the enrollment message exchange.

   Yet the use of TLS has the limitation that this cannot provide
   auditability nor end-to-end security for the certificate enrollment
   request because the TLS session is transient and terminates at the
   registrar.  This is a problem in particular if the enrollment is done
   via multiple hops, part of which may not even be network-based.

   A further limitation of using EST as the certificate enrollment
   protocol is that due to using PKCS#10 structures in enrollment
   requests, the only possible proof-of-possession method is a self-
   signature, which excludes requesting certificates for key types that
   do not support signing.

Appendix B.  Application examples

   This informative annex provides some detail to the application
   examples listed in Section 3.2.

B.1.  Rolling stock

   Rolling stock or railroad cars contain a variety of sensors,
   actuators, and controllers, which communicate within the railroad car
   but also exchange information between railroad cars building a train,
   with track-side equipment, and/or possibly with backend systems.
   These devices are typically unaware of backend system connectivity.
   Managing certificates may be done during maintenance cycles of the
   railroad car, but can already be prepared during operation.
   Preparation will include generating certification requests, which are
   collected and later forwarded for processing, once the railroad car
   is connected to the operator backend.  The authorization of the
   certification request is then done based on the operator's asset/
   inventory information in the backend.

   UNISIG has included a CMP profile for enrollment of TLS certificates
   of on-board and track-side components in the Subset-137 specifying
   the ETRAM/ETCS on-line key management for train control systems
   [UNISIG-Subset-137].

B.2.  Building automation

   In building automation scenarios, a detached building or the basement
   of a building may be equipped with sensors, actuators, and
   controllers that are connected with each other in a local network but
   with only limited or no connectivity to a central building management
   system.  This problem may occur during installation time but also
   during operation.  In such a situation a service technician collects
   the necessary data and transfers it between the local network and the
   central building management system, e.g., using a laptop or a mobile
   phone.  This data may comprise parameters and settings required in
   the operational phase of the sensors/actuators, like a component
   certificate issued by the operator to authenticate against other
   components and services.

   The collected data may be provided by a domain registrar already
   existing in the local network.  In this case connectivity to the
   backend PKI may be facilitated by the service technician's laptop.
   Alternatively, the data can also be collected from the pledges
   directly and provided to a domain registrar deployed in a different
   network as preparation for the operational phase.  In this case,
   connectivity to the domain registrar may also be facilitated by the
   service technician's laptop.

B.3.  Substation automation

   In electrical substation automation scenarios, a control center
   typically hosts PKI services to issue certificates for Intelligent
   Electronic Devices (IEDs) operated in a substation.  Communication
   between the substation and control center is performed through a
   proxy/gateway/DMZ, which terminates protocol flows.  Note that
   [NERC-CIP-005-5] requires inspection of protocols at the boundary of
   a security perimeter (the substation in this case).  In addition,
   security management in substation automation assumes central support
   of several enrollment protocols in order to support the various
   capabilities of IEDs from different vendors.  The IEC standard
   IEC62351-9 [IEC-62351-9] specifies mandatory support of two
   enrollment protocols: SCEP [RFC8894] and EST [RFC7030] for the
   infrastructure side, while the IED must only support one of the two.

B.4.  Electric vehicle charging infrastructure

   For electric vehicle charging infrastructure, protocols have been
   defined for the interaction between the electric vehicle and the
   charging point (e.g., ISO 15118-2 [ISO-IEC-15118-2]) as well as
   between the charging point and the charging point operator (e.g.
   OCPP [OCPP]).  Depending on the authentication model, unilateral or
   mutual authentication is required.  In both cases the charging point
   uses an X.509 certificate to authenticate itself in TLS connections
   between the electric vehicle and the charging point.  The management
   of this certificate depends, among others, on the selected backend
   connectivity protocol.  In the case of OCPP, this protocol is meant
   to be the only communication protocol between the charging point and
   the backend, carrying all information to control the charging
   operations and maintain the charging point itself.  This means that
   the certificate management needs to be handled in-band of OCPP.  This
   requires the ability to encapsulate the certificate management
   messages in a transport-independent way.  Authenticated self-
   containment will support this by allowing the transport without a
   separate enrollment protocol, binding the messages to the identity of
   the communicating endpoints.

B.5.  Infrastructure isolation policy

   This refers to any case in which network infrastructure is normally
   isolated from the Internet as a matter of policy, most likely for
   security reasons.  In such a case, limited access to external PKI
   services will be allowed in carefully controlled short periods of
   time, for example when a batch of new devices is deployed, and
   forbidden or prevented at other times.

B.6.  Less operational security in the target domain

   The registration authority performing (at least part of) the
   authorization of a certification request is a critical PKI component
   and therefore requires higher operational security than components
   utilizing the issued certificates for their security features.  CAs
   may also demand higher security in the registration procedures.
   Especially the CA/Browser forum currently increases the security
   requirements in the certificate issuance procedures for publicly
   trusted certificates.  There may be situations where the target
   domain does not offer a sufficient level of security to operate a
   registration authority and therefore wants to transfer this service
   to a backend service that offers a higher security level.

Appendix C.  History of changes TBD RFC Editor: please delete

   From IETF draft 04 -> IETF draft 05:

   *  David von Oheimb became the editor.

   *  Streamline wording, improve grammar, etc. throughout the text.

   *  Shift the emphasis towards supporting alternative enrollment
      protocols.

   *  Update the title accordingly - preliminary change to be approved.

   *  Move comments on EST and detailed application examples to
      informative annex.

   From IETF draft 03 -> IETF draft 04:

   *  Moved UC2 related parts defining the pledge in responder mode to a
      separate document.  This required changes and adaptations in
      several sections.  Main changes concerned the removal of the
      subsection for UC2 as well as the removal of the YANG model
      related text as it is not applicable in UC1.

   *  Updated references to the Lightweight CMP Profile.

   *  Added David von Oheimb as co-author.

   From IETF draft 02 -> IETF draft 03:

   *  Housekeeping, deleted open issue regarding YANG voucher-request in
      UC2 as voucher-request was enhanced with additional leaf.

   *  Included open issues in YANG model in UC2 regarding assertion
      value agent-proximity and CSR encapsulation using SZTP sub
      module).

   From IETF draft 01 -> IETF draft 02:

   *  Defined call flow and objects for interactions in UC2.  Object
      format based on draft for JOSE signed voucher artifacts and
      aligned the remaining objects with this approach in UC2 .

   *  Terminology change: issue #2 pledge-agent -> registrar-agent to
      better underline agent relation.

   *  Terminology change: issue #3 PULL/PUSH -> pledge-initiator-mode
      and pledge-responder-mode to better address the pledge operation.

   *  Communication approach between pledge and registrar-agent changed
      by removing TLS-PSK (former section TLS establishment) and
      associated references to other drafts in favor of relying on
      higher layer exchange of signed data objects.  These data objects
      are included also in the pledge-voucher-request and lead to an
      extension of the YANG module for the voucher-request (issue #12).

   *  Details on trust relationship between registrar-agent and
      registrar (issue #4, #5, #9) included in UC2.

   *  Recommendation regarding short-lived certificates for registrar-
      agent authentication towards registrar (issue #7) in the security
      considerations.

   *  Introduction of reference to agent signing certificate using SKID
      in agent signed data (issue #11).

   *  Enhanced objects in exchanges between pledge and registrar-agent
      to allow the registrar to verify agent-proximity to the pledge
      (issue #1) in UC2.

   *  Details on trust relationship between registrar-agent and pledge
      (issue #5) included in UC2.

   *  Split of use case 2 call flow into sub sections in UC2.

   From IETF draft 00 -> IETF draft 01:

   *  Update of scope in Section 3.1 to include in which the pledge acts
      as a server.  This is one main motivation for use case 2.

   *  Rework of use case 2 to consider the transport between the pledge
      and the pledge-agent.  Addressed is the TLS channel establishment
      between the pledge-agent and the pledge as well as the endpoint
      definition on the pledge.

   *  First description of exchanged object types (needs more work)

   *  Clarification in discovery options for enrollment endpoints at the
      domain registrar based on well-known endpoints in Section 5.3 do
      not result in additional /.well-known URIs.  Update of the
      illustrative example.  Note that the change to /brski for the
      voucher related endpoints has been taken over in the BRSKI main
      document.

   *  Updated references.

   *  Included Thomas Werner as additional author for the document.

   From individual version 03 -> IETF draft 00:

   *  Inclusion of discovery options of enrollment endpoints at the
      domain registrar based on well-known endpoints in Section 5.3 as
      replacement of section 5.1.3 in the individual draft.  This is
      intended to support both use cases in the document.  An
      illustrative example is provided.

   *  Missing details provided for the description and call flow in
      pledge-agent use case UC2, e.g. to accommodate distribution of CA
      certificates.

   *  Updated CMP example in Section 6 to use Lightweight CMP instead of
      CMP, as the draft already provides the necessary /.well-known
      endpoints.

   *  Requirements discussion moved to separate section in Section 4.
      Shortened description of proof of identity binding and mapping to
      existing protocols.

   *  Removal of copied call flows for voucher exchange and registrar
      discovery flow from [RFC8995] in Section 5 to avoid doubling or
      text or inconsistencies.

   *  Reworked abstract and introduction to be more crisp regarding the
      targeted solution.  Several structural changes in the document to
      have a better distinction between requirements, use case
      description, and solution description as separate sections.
      History moved to appendix.

   From individual version 02 -> 03:

   *  Update of terminology from self-contained to authenticated self-
      contained object to be consistent in the wording and to underline
      the protection of the object with an existing credential.  Note
      that the naming of this object may be discussed.  An alternative
      name may be attestation object.

   *  Simplification of the architecture approach for the initial use
      case having an offsite PKI.

   *  Introduction of a new use case utilizing authenticated self-
      contain objects to onboard a pledge using a commissioning tool
      containing a pledge-agent.  This requires additional changes in
      the BRSKI call flow sequence and led to changes in the
      introduction, the application example,and also in the related
      BRSKI-AE call flow.

   *  Update of provided examples of the addressing approach used in
      BRSKI to allow for support of multiple enrollment protocols in
      Section 5.2.5.

   From individual version 01 -> 02:

   *  Update of introduction text to clearly relate to the usage of
      IDevID and LDevID.

   *  Definition of the addressing approach used in BRSKI to allow for
      support of multiple enrollment protocols in Section 5.2.5.  This
      section also contains a first discussion of an optional discovery
      mechanism to address situations in which the registrar supports
      more than one enrollment approach.  Discovery should avoid that
      the pledge performs a trial and error of enrollment protocols.

   *  Update of description of architecture elements and changes to
      BRSKI in Section 5.1.

   *  Enhanced consideration of existing enrollment protocols in the
      context of mapping the requirements to existing solutions in
      Section 4 and in Section 6.

   From individual version 00 -> 01:

   *  Update of examples, specifically for building automation as well
      as two new application use cases in Appendix B.

   *  Deletion of asynchronous interaction with MASA to not complicate
      the use case.  Note that the voucher exchange can already be
      handled in an asynchronous manner and is therefore not considered
      further.  This resulted in removal of the alternative path the
      MASA in Figure 1 and the associated description in Section 5.1.

   *  Enhancement of description of architecture elements and changes to
      BRSKI in Section 5.1.

   *  Consideration of existing enrollment protocols in the context of
      mapping the requirements to existing solutions in Section 4.

   *  New section starting Section 6 with the mapping to existing
      enrollment protocols by collecting boundary conditions.
