          BRSKI-AE: Alternative Enrollment Protocols in BRSKI
                      draft-ietf-anima-brski-ae-03

Abstract

   This document enhances Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure
   (BRSKI, RFC 8995) to allow employing alternative enrollment
   protocols, such as CMP.

   Using self-contained signed objects, the origin of enrollment
   requests and responses can be authenticated independently of message
   transfer.  This supports end-to-end security and asynchronous
   operation of certificate enrollment and provides flexibility where to
   authenticate and authorize certification requests.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   BRSKI, as defined in [RFC8995], specifies a solution for secure
   automated zero-touch bootstrapping of new devices, which are given
   the name _pledges_, in the domain they should operate with.  This
   includes the discovery of the registrar representing the target
   domain, time synchronization or validation, and the exchange of
   security information necessary to establish mutual trust between
   pledges and the target domain.  As explained in Section 2, the
   _target domain_, or _domain_ for short, is defined as the set of
   entities that share a common local trust anchor.

1.1.1.  Voucher Exchange for Trust Anchor Establishment

   Initially, a pledge has a trust anchor only of its manufacturer, not
   yet of any target domain.  In order for the pledge to automatically
   and securely obtain trust in a suitable target domain represented by
   its registrar, BRSKI uses vouchers as defined in [RFC8366].  A
   voucher is a cryptographic object issued by the Manufacturer
   Authorized Signing Authority (MASA) of the pledge manufacturer to the
   specific pledge identified by the included device serial number.  It
   is signed with the credentials of the MASA and can be validated by
   the manufacturer trust anchor imprinted with the pledge.  So the
   pledge can accept the voucher contents, which indicate to the pledge
   that it can trust the domain identified by the given certificate.

   While RFC 8995 only specifies a single, online set of protocol option
   to communicate the voucher between MASA, registrar, and pledge
   (BRSKI-EST and BRSKI-MASA, see [RFC8995], Section 2), it also
   describes the architecture for how the voucher may be provided in
   online mode (synchronously) or offline mode (asynchronously).  So for
   the voucher exchange offline mode is basically supported because the
   vouchers are self-contained signed objects, such that their security
   does not rely on protection by the underlying transfer.

Internet-Draft                  BRSKI-AE                    October 2022


   SZTP [RFC8572] is an example of another protocol where vouchers may
   be delivered asynchronously by tools such as portable USB "thumb"
   drives.  However, SZTP does not do signed voucher requests, so it
   does not allow the domain to verify the identity of the device in the
   same way, nor does it deploy LDevIDs to the device in the same way.

1.1.2.  Enrollment of LDevID Certificate

   Trust in a pledge by other devices in the target domain is enabled by
   enrolling the pledge with a domain-specific Locally significant
   Device IDentity (LDevID) certificate.

   Recall that for certificate enrollment it is crucial to authenticate
   the entity requesting the certificate.  Checking both the identity
   and the authorization of the requester is the job of a registration
   authority (RA).  With BRSKI-EST, there is only one RA instance, co-
   located with the registrar.

   The certification request of the pledge is signed using its IDevID
   secret.  It can be validated by the target domain (e.g., by the
   domain registrar) using the trust anchor of the pledge manufacturer,
   which needs to pre-installed in the domain.

   For enrolling devices with LDevID certificates, BRSKI specifies how
   Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) [RFC7030] can be used.  EST
   has its specific characteristics, detailed in Appendix A.  In
   particular, it requires online on-site availability of the RA for
   performing the data origin authentication and final authorization
   decision on the certification request.  This type of enrollment can
   be called 'synchronous enrollment'.  EST, BRSKI-EST, and BRSKI-MASA
   as used in RFC 8995 are tied to a specific transport, TLS, which may
   not be suitable for the target use case outlined by the examples in
   Section 1.3.  Therefore deployments may require different transport,
   see Constrained Voucher Artifacts for Bootstrapping Protocols
   [I-D.ietf-anima-constrained-voucher] and EST-coaps [RFC9148].

   Since EST does not support offline enrollment, it may be preferable
   for the reasons given in this section and depending on application
   scenarios as outlined in Section 1.3 and Appendix B to use
   alternative enrollment protocols such as the Certificate Management
   Protocol (CMP) [RFC4210] profiled in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile] or Certificate Management
   over CMS (CMC) [RFC5272].  These protocols are more flexible, and by
   representing the certification request messages as authenticated
   self-contained objects, they are designed to be independent of the
   transfer mechanism.

   Depending on the application scenario, the required components of an
   RA may not be part of the BRSKI registrar.  They even may not be
   available on-site but rather be provided by remote backend systems.
   The RA functionality may also be split into an on-site local RA (LRA)
   and a central RA component in the backend, referred to as PKI RA.
   For certification authorities (CAs) it is common to be located in the
   backend.  The registrar or its deployment site may not have an online
   connection with these RA/CA components or the connectivity may be
   intermittent.  This may be due to security requirements for operating
   the backend systems or due to deployments where on-site or always-
   online operation may be not feasible or too costly.  In such
   scenarios, the authentication and authorization of certification
   requests will not or can not be performed on-site.

   In this document, enrollment that is not performed over an online
   connection is called 'asynchronous enrollment'.  Asynchronous
   enrollment means that messages need to be forwarded through offline
   methods (e.g., Sneakernet/USB sticks) and/or at some point in time
   only part of the communication path is available.  Messages need to
   be stored, along with the information needed for authenticating their
   origin, in front of an unavailable segment for potentially long time
   (e.g., days) before they can be forwarded.  This implies that end-to-
   end security between the parties involved can not be provided by an
   authenticated (and often confidential) communications channel such as
   TLS used in EST/BRSKI-EST/BRSKI-MASA.

   Application scenarios may also involve network segmentation, which is
   utilized in industrial systems to separate domains with different
   security needs -- see also Appendix B.5.  Such scenarios lead to
   similar requirements if the TLS channel that carries the requester
   authentication is terminated before the actual requester
   authorization is performed.  Thus request messages need to be
   forwarded on further channels before the registrar or RA can
   authorize the certification request.  In order to preserve the
   requester authentication, authentication information needs to be
   retained and ideally bound directly to the certification request.

   There are basically two approaches for forwarding certification
   requests along with requester authentication information:

   *  The component in the target domain that forwards the certification
      request, such as a local RA being part of the registrar, combines
      the certification request with the validated identity of the
      requester (e,g., its IDevID certificate) and an indication of
      successful verification of the proof of possession (of the
      corresponding private key) in a way preventing changes to the
      combined information.  This implies that it must be trusted by the
      PKI.  When connectivity is available, the trusted component



von Oheimb, et al.        Expires 27 April 2023                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                  BRSKI-AE                    October 2022


      forwards the certification request together with the requester
      information (authentication and proof of possession) for further
      processing.  This approach offers hop-by-hop security, but not
      end-to-end security.

      In BRSKI, the EST server, being co-located with the registrar in
      the domain, is such a component that needs to be trusted by the
      backend PKI components.  They must rely on the local pledge
      authentication result provided by that component when performing
      the final authorization of the certification request.

   *  A trusted intermediate domain component is not needed when
      involved components use authenticated self-contained objects for
      the enrollment, directly binding the certification request and the
      requester authentication in a cryptographic way.  This approach
      supports end-to-end security, without the need to trust in
      intermediate domain components.  Manipulation of the request and
      the requester identity information can be detected during the
      validation of the self-contained signed object.

      Note that with this approach the way in which enrollment requests
      are forwarded by the registrar to the backend PKI components does
      not contribute to their security and therefore does not need to be
      addressed here.

   Focus of this document is the support of alternative enrollment
   protocols that allow the second approach, i.e., using authenticated
   self-contained objects for device certificate enrollment.  This
   enhancement of BRSKI is named BRSKI-AE, where AE stands for
   *A*lternative *E*nrollment and for *A*synchronous *E*nrollment.  This
   specification carries over the main characteristics of BRSKI, namely
   that the pledge obtains trust anchor information for authenticating
   the domain registrar and other target domain components as well as a
   domain-specific X.509 device certificate (the LDevID certificate)
   along with the corresponding private key (the LDevID secret) and
   certificate chain.

   The goals are to provide an enhancement of BRSKI using enrollment
   protocols alternatively to EST that

   *  support end-to-end security for LDevID certificate enrollment and

   *  make it applicable to scenarios involving asynchronous enrollment.

   This is achieved by

Internet-Draft                  BRSKI-AE                    October 2022


   *  extending the well-known URI approach of BRSKI and EST message
      with an additional path element indicating the enrollment protocol
      being used, and

   *  defining a certificate waiting indication and handling, for the
      case that the certifying component is (temporarily) not available.

   This specification can be applied to both synchronous and
   asynchronous enrollment.

   As an improvement over BRSKI, this specification supports offering
   multiple enrollment protocols which enables pledges and their
   developers to pick the preferred one.

1.2.  Supported Environments

   BRSKI-AE is intended to be used in domains that may have limited
   support of on-site PKI services and comprises application scenarios
   like the following.

   *  Scenarios indirectly excluding the use of EST for certificate
      enrollment, such as the requirement for end-to-end authentication
      of the requester while the RA is not co-located with the
      registrar.

   *  Scenarios having implementation restrictions that speak against
      using EST for certificate enrollment, such as the use of a library
      that does not support EST but CMP.

   *  Pledges and/or the target domain already having an established
      certificate management approach different from EST that shall be
      reused (e.g., in brownfield installations where CMP is used).

   *  No RA being available on site in the target domain.  Connectivity
      to an off-site PKI RA is intermittent or entirely offline.  A
      store-and-forward mechanism is used for communicating with the
      off-site services.

   *  Authoritative actions of a local RA being not sufficient for fully
      authorizing certification requests by pledges.  Final
      authorization then is done by a PKI RA residing in the backend.

1.3.  List of Application Examples

   Bootstrapping can be handled in various ways, depending on the
   application domains.  The informative Appendix B provides
   illustrative examples from various industrial control system
   environments and operational setups.  They motivate the support of
   alternative enrollment protocols, based on the following examples of
   operational environments:

   *  Rolling stock

   *  Building automation

   *  Electrical substation automation

   *  Electric vehicle charging infrastructures

   *  Infrastructure isolation policy

   *  Sites with insufficient level of operational security

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document relies on the terminology defined in [RFC8995] and
   [IEEE.802.1AR-2018].  The following terms are defined partly in
   addition.

   asynchronous communication:  time-wise interrupted communication
      between a pledge and a registrar or PKI component.

   authenticated self-contained object:  data structure that is
      cryptographically bound to the IDevID certificate of a pledge.
      The binding is assumed to be provided through a digital signature
      of the actual object using the IDevID secret.

   backend:  same as off-site

   BRSKI-AE:  Variation of BRSKI [RFC8995] in which BRSKI-EST, the

      enrollment protocol between pledge and the registrar including the
      RA, is replaced by alternative enrollment protocols such as
      Lightweight CMP.  To this end a new URI scheme used for performing
      the certificate enrollment.  BRSKI-AE enables the use of other
      enrollment protocols between pledge and registrar and to any
      backend RA components with end-to-end security.

   CA:  Certification Authority, which is the PKI component that issues
      certificates and provides certificate status information.

   domain:  shorthand for target domain

   IDevID:  Initial Device IDentifier, provided by the manufacturer and
      comprising of a private key, an X.509 certificate with chain, and
      a related trust anchor.

   LDevID:  Locally significant Device IDentifier, provided by the
      target domain and comprising of a private key, an X.509
      certificate with chain, and a related trust anchor.

   local RA (LRA):  RA that is on site with the registrar and that may
      be needed in addition to an off-site RA.

   on-site:  locality of a component or service or functionality in the
      local target deployment site of the registrar.

   off-site:  locality of component or service or functionality in an
      operator site different from the target deployment site.  This may
      be a central site or a cloud service, to which only a temporary
      connection is available.

   PKI RA:  off-site RA in the backend of the target domain

   pledge:  device that is to be bootstrapped to the target domain.  It
      requests an LDevID using an IDevID installed by its manufacturer.

   RA:  Registration Authority, which is the PKI component to which a CA
      typically delegates certificate management functions such as
      authenticating requesters and performing authorization checks on
      certification requests.

   site:  the locality where an entity, e.g., pledge, registrar, RA, CA,
      is deployed.  Different sites can belong to the same target
      domain.

   synchronous communication:  time-wise uninterrupted communication
      between a pledge and a registrar or PKI component.

Internet-Draft                  BRSKI-AE                    October 2022


   target domain:  the set of entities that the pledge should be able to
      operate with and that share a common local trust anchor,
      independent of where the entities are deployed.

3.  Requirements and Mapping to Solutions

3.1.  Basic Requirements

   There are two main drivers for the definition of BRSKI-AE:

   *  The solution architecture may already use or require a certificate
      management protocol other than EST.  Therefore, this other
      protocol should be usable for requesting LDevID certificates.

   *  The domain registrar may not be the (final) point that
      authenticates and authorizes certification requests, and the
      pledge may not have a direct connection to it.  Therefore,
      certification requests should be self-contained signed objects.

   Based on the intended target environment described in Section 1.2 and
   the application examples described in Appendix B, the following
   requirements are derived to support authenticated self-contained
   objects as containers carrying certification requests.

   At least the following properties are required for a certification
   request:

   *  _Proof of possession_: demonstrates access to the private key
      corresponding to the public key contained in a certification
      request.  This is typically achieved by a self-signature using the
      corresponding private key.

   *  _Proof of identity_, also called _proof of origin_: provides data
      origin authentication of the certification request.  Typically
      this is achieved by a signature using the pledge IDevID secret
      over some data, which needs to include a sufficiently strong
      identifier of the pledge, such as the device serial number
      typically included in the subject of the IDevID certificate.

   The rest of this section gives an non-exhaustive list of solution
   examples, based on existing technology described in IETF documents:

3.2.  Solution Options for Proof of Possession

   Certification request objects: Certification requests are data
   structures protecting only the integrity of the contained data and
   providing proof of possession for a (locally generated) private key.
   Examples for certification request data structures are:



von Oheimb, et al.        Expires 27 April 2023                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                  BRSKI-AE                    October 2022


   *  PKCS#10 [RFC2986].  This certification request structure is self-
      signed to protect its integrity and to prove possession of the
      private key that corresponds to the public key included in the
      request.

   *  CRMF [RFC4211].  This certificate request message format also
      supports integrity protection and proof of possession, typically
      by a self-signature generated over (part of) the structure with
      the private key corresponding to the included public key.  CRMF
      also supports further proof-of-possession methods for types of
      keys that do not support any signature algorithm.

   The integrity protection of certification request fields includes the
   public key because it is part of the data signed by the corresponding
   private key.  Yet note that for the above examples this is not
   sufficient to provide data origin authentication, i.e., proof of
   identity.  This extra property can be achieved by an additional
   binding to the IDevID of the pledge.  This binding to the source
   authentication supports the authorization decision of the
   certification request.  The binding of data origin authentication to
   the certification request may be delegated to the protocol used for
   certificate management.

3.3.  Solution Options for Proof of Identity

   The certification request should be bound to an existing
   authenticated credential (here, the IDevID certificate) to enable a
   proof of identity and, based on it, an authorization of the
   certification request.  The binding may be achieved through security
   options in an underlying transport protocol such as TLS if the
   authorization of the certification request is (completely) done at
   the next communication hop.  This binding can also be done in a
   transport-independent way by wrapping the certification request with
   a signature employing an existing IDevID.  In the BRSKI context, this
   will be the IDevID.  This requirement is addressed by existing
   enrollment protocols in various ways, such as:

   *  EST [RFC7030] utilizes PKCS#10 to encode the certification
      request.  The Certificate Signing Request (CSR) optionally
      provides a binding to the underlying TLS session by including the
      tls-unique value in the self-signed PKCS#10 structure.  The tls-
      unique value results from the TLS handshake.  Since the TLS
      handshake includes certificate-based client authentication and the
      pledge utilizes its IDevID for it, the proof of identity is
      provided by such a binding to the TLS session.  This can be
      supported using the EST /simpleenroll endpoint.  Note that the
      binding of the TLS handshake to the CSR is optional in EST.

      [RFC7030], Section 2.5 sketches wrapping the CSR with a Full PKI
      Request message sent to the /fullcmc endpoint.  This would allow
      for source authentication at message level as an alternative to
      indirectly binding to the underlying TLS authentication in the
      transport layer.

   *  SCEP [RFC8894] supports using a shared secret (passphrase) or an
      existing certificate to protect CSRs based on SCEP Secure Message
      Objects using CMS wrapping ([RFC5652]).  Note that the wrapping
      using an existing IDevID in SCEP is referred to as _renewal_. This
      way SCEP does not rely on the security of the underlying message
      transfer.

   *  CMP [RFC4210] supports using a shared secret (passphrase) or an
      existing certificate, which may be an IDevID credential, to
      authenticate certification requests via the PKIProtection
      structure in a PKIMessage.  The certification request is typically
      encoded utilizing CRMF, while PKCS#10 is supported as an
      alternative.  Thus, CMP does not rely on the security of the
      underlying message transfer.

   *  CMC [RFC5272] also supports utilizing a shared secret (passphrase)
      or an existing certificate to protect certification requests,
      which can be either in CRMF or PKCS#10 structure.  The proof of
      identity can be provided as part of a FullCMCRequest, based on CMS
      [RFC5652] and signed with an existing IDevID secret.  Thus also
      CMC does not rely on the security of the underlying message
      transfer.

4.  Adaptations to BRSKI

   In order to support alternative certificate enrollment protocols,
   asynchronous enrollment, and more general system architectures,
   BRSKI-AE provides some generalizations on BRSKI [RFC8995].  This way,
   authenticated self-contained objects such as those described in
   Section 3 above can be used for certificate enrollment, and RA
   functionality can be distributed freely in the target domain.

   The enhancements needed are kept to a minimum in order to ensure
   reuse of already defined architecture elements and interactions.  In
   general, the communication follows the BRSKI model and utilizes the
   existing BRSKI architecture elements.  In particular, the pledge
   initiates communication with the domain registrar and interacts with
   the MASA as usual for voucher request and response processing.

4.1.  Architecture

   The key element of BRSKI-AE is that the authorization of a
   certification request MUST be performed based on an authenticated
   self-contained object.  The certification request is bound in a self-
   contained way to a proof of origin based on the IDevID.
   Consequently, the authentication and authorization of the
   certification request MAY be done by the domain registrar and/or by
   other domain components.  These components may be offline or reside
   in some central backend of the domain operator (off-site) as
   described in Section 1.2.  The registrar and other on-site domain
   components may have no or only temporary (intermittent) connectivity
   to them.  The certification request MAY also be piggybacked on
   another protocol.

   This leads to generalizations in the placement and enhancements of
   the logical elements as shown in Figure 1.

       Figure 1: Architecture Overview Using Off-site PKI Components

   The architecture overview in Figure 1 has the same logical elements
   as BRSKI, but with more flexible placement of the authentication and
   authorization checks on certification requests.  Depending on the
   application scenario, the registrar MAY still do all of these checks
   (as is the case in BRSKI), or part of them, or none of them.

   The following list describes the on-site components in the target
   domain of the pledge shown in Figure 1.

   *  Join Proxy: same functionality as described in BRSKI [RFC8995],
      Section 4

Internet-Draft                  BRSKI-AE                    October 2022


   *  Domain Registrar including RA, LRA, or Enrollment Proxy: in BRSKI-
      AE, the domain registrar has mostly the same functionality as in
      BRSKI, namely to facilitate the communication of the pledge with
      the MASA and the PKI.  Yet there are two generalizations:

      1.  The registrar MUST support at least one certificate enrollment
          protocol that uses for certificate requests authenticated
          self-contained objects.  To this end, the URI scheme for
          addressing the endpoint at the registrar is generalized (see
          Section 4.3).

          To support the end-to-end proof of identity of the pledge, the
          enrollment protocol used by the pledge MUST also be used by
          the registrar for its upstream certificate enrollment message
          exchange with backend PKI components.  Between the pledge and
          the registrar the enrollment request messages are tunneled
          over the TLS channel already established between these
          entities.  The registrar optionally checks the requests and
          then passes them on to the PKI.  On the way back, it forwards
          responses by the PKI to the pledge on the existing TLS
          channel.

      2.  The registrar MAY also delegate all or part of its certificate
          enrollment support to a separate system.  That is,
          alternatively to having full RA functionality, the registrar
          may act as a local registration authority (LRA) or just as an
          enrollment proxy.  In such cases, the domain registrar may
          forward the certification request to some off-site RA
          component, also called PKI RA here, that performs the
          remaining parts of the enrollment request validation and
          authorization.  This also covers the case that the registrar
          has only intermittent connection and forwards certification
          requests to off-site PKI components upon re-established
          connectivity.

          Still all certificate enrollment traffic goes via the
          registrar, such that from the pledge perspective there is no
          difference in connectivity and the registrar is involved in
          all steps.  The final step of BRSKI, namely the enrollment
          status telemetry, is also kept.

   The following list describes the components provided by the vendor or
   manufacturer outside the target domain.

   *  MASA: functionality as described in BRSKI [RFC8995].  The voucher
      exchange with the MASA via the domain registrar is performed as
      described in BRSKI.

Internet-Draft                  BRSKI-AE                    October 2022


      Note: From the definition of the interaction with the MASA in
      [RFC8995], Section 5 follows that it may be synchronous (voucher
      request with nonce) or asynchronous (voucher request without
      nonce).

   *  Ownership tracker: as defined in BRSKI.

   The following list describes the target domain components that can
   optionally be operated in the off-site backend of the target domain.

   *  PKI RA: Performs certificate management functions for the domain
      as a centralized public-key infrastructure for the domain
      operator.  As far as not already done by the domain registrar, it
      performs the final validation and authorization of certification
      requests.  Otherwise, the RA co-located with the domain registrar
      directly connects to the PKI CA.

   *  PKI CA: Performs certificate generation by signing the certificate
      structure requested in already authenticated and authorized
      certification requests.

   Based on the diagram in BRSKI [RFC8995], Section 2.1 and the
   architectural changes, the original protocol flow is divided into
   four phases showing commonalities and differences to the original
   approach as follows.

   *  Discovery phase: same as in BRSKI steps (1) and (2).

   *  Voucher exchange phase: same as in BRSKI steps (3) and (4).

   *  Certificate enrollment phase: the use of EST in step (5) is
      changed to employing a certificate enrollment protocol that uses
      an authenticated self-contained object for requesting the LDevID
      certificate.

      Still for transporting certificate enrollment request and response
      messages between the pledge and the registrar, the TLS channel
      established between them via the join proxy is used.  So the
      enrollment protocol MUST support this.  Due to this architecture,
      the pledge does not need to establish an additional connection for
      certificate enrollment and the registrar retains control over the
      certificate enrollment traffic.

   *  Enrollment status telemetry phase: the final exchange of BRSKI
      step (5).

4.2.  Message Exchange

   The behavior of a pledge described in BRSKI [RFC8995], Section 2.1 is
   kept with one exception.  After finishing the Imprint step (4), the
   Enroll step (5) MUST be performed with an enrollment protocol
   utilizing authenticated self-contained objects.  Section 5 discusses
   selected suitable enrollment protocols and options applicable.

               Figure 2: BRSKI-AE Abstract Protocol Overview

4.2.1.  Pledge - Registrar Discovery

   The discovery is done as specified in [RFC8995].

4.2.2.  Pledge - Registrar - MASA Voucher Exchange

   The voucher exchange is performed as specified in [RFC8995].

4.2.3.  Pledge - Registrar - RA/CA Certificate Enrollment

   The certificate enrollment phase may involve several exchanges of
   requests and responses.  Which of the message exchanges marked
   OPTIONAL in the below Figure 3 are potentially used, or are actually
   required or prohibited to be used, depends on the application
   scenario and on the employed enrollment protocol.

   These OPTIONAL exchanges cover all those supported by the use of EST
   in BRSKI.  The last OPTIONAL one, namely certificate confirmation, is
   not supported by EST, but by CMP and other enrollment protocols.

   The only generally MANDATORY message exchange is for the actual
   certificate request and response.  As stated in Section 3, the
   certificate request MUST be performed using an authenticated self-
   contained object providing not only proof of possession but also
   proof of identity (source authentication).

   The various connections between the registrar and the PKI components
   of the operator (RA/CA) may be intermittent or off-line.  Messages
   are to be sent as soon as sufficient transfer capacity is available.

   The label [OPTIONAL forwarding] means that on receiving from a pledge
   a request of the given type (or a certificate confirmation), the
   registrar MAY answer the request directly itself.  Otherwise the
   registrar MUST forward the request to a backend PKI component and
   forward any resulting response back to the pledge.

Internet-Draft                  BRSKI-AE                    October 2022


   Notes: The decision whether to forward a request or to answer it
   directly can depend on various static and dynamic factors, such as
   the application scenario, the capabilities of the registrar and of
   the local RA possibly co-located with the registrar, the enrollment
   protocol being used, and the specific contents of the request.

   There are several options how the registrar could be able to directly
   answer requests for CA certificates or for certificate request
   attributes.  It could cache responses obtained from the backend PKI
   and later use their contents for responding to requests asking for
   the same data.  The contents could also be explicit provisioned at
   the registrar.

   Certificate requests typically need to be handled by the backend PKI,
   but the registrar can answer part of them if adequate, such as
   returning an error response in case the registrar determines that the
   request is not properly authenticated or not authorized.

   Also certificate confirmation messages will usually be forwarded to
   the backend PKI, but if the registrar knows that they are not needed
   or wanted there it can acknowledge such messages directly.

   The following list provides an abstract description of the flow
   depicted in Figure 3.

   *  CA Certs Request (1): The pledge optionally requests the latest
      relevant CA certificates.  This ensures that the pledge has the
      complete set of current CA certificates beyond the pinned-domain-
      cert (which is contained in the voucher and may be just the domain
      registrar certificate).

   *  CA Certs Response (2): This MUST contain the current root CA
      certificate, which typically is the LDevID trust anchor, and any
      additional certificates that the pledge may need to validate
      certificates.

   *  Attribute Request (3): Typically, the automated bootstrapping
      occurs without local administrative configuration of the pledge.
      Nevertheless, there are cases in which the pledge may also include
      additional attributes specific to the target domain into the
      certification request.  To get these attributes in advance, the
      attribute request can be used.

      For example, [RFC8994], Section 6.11.7.2 specifies how the
      attribute request is used to signal to the pledge the acp-node-
      name field required for enrollment into an ACP domain.

   *  Attribute Response (4): This MUST contain the attributes to be
      included in the subsequent certification request.

   *  Certificate Request (5): This MUST contain the authenticated self-
      contained object ensuring both proof of possession of the
      corresponding private key and proof of identity of the requester.

   *  Certificate Response (6): This MUST contain on success the
      requested certificate and MAY include further information, like
      certificates of intermediate CAs.

   *  Certificate Confirm (7): An optional confirmation sent after the
      requested certificate has been received and validated.  It
      contains a positive or negative confirmation by the pledge to the
      PKI whether the certificate was successfully enrolled and fits its
      needs.

   *  PKI/Registrar Confirm (8): An acknowledgment by the PKI that MUST
      be sent on reception of the Cert Confirm.

   The generic messages described above may be implemented using any
   certificate enrollment protocol that supports authenticated self-
   contained objects for the certificate request as described in
   Section 3 and tunneling over TLS.  Examples are available in
   Section 5.

   Note that the optional certificate confirmation by the pledge to the
   PKI described above is independent of the mandatory enrollment status
   telemetry done between the pledge and the registrar in the final
   phase of BRSKI-AE, described next.

4.2.4.  Pledge - Registrar Enrollment Status Telemetry

   The enrollment status telemetry is performed as specified in
   [RFC8995].

   In BRSKI this is described as part of the enrollment step, but due to
   the generalization on the enrollment protocol described in this
   document its regarded as a separate phase here.

4.3.  Enhancements to the Endpoint Addressing Scheme of BRSKI

   BRSKI-AE provides generalizations to the addressing scheme defined in
   BRSKI [RFC8995], Section 5 to accommodate alternative enrollment
   protocols that use authenticated self-contained objects for
   certification requests.  As this is supported by various existing
   enrollment protocols, they can be employed without modifications to
   existing PKI RAs/CAs supporting the respective enrollment protocol



von Oheimb, et al.        Expires 27 April 2023                [Page 20]

Internet-Draft                  BRSKI-AE                    October 2022


   (see also Section 5).

   The addressing scheme in BRSKI for certification requests and the
   related CA certificates and CSR attributes retrieval functions uses
   the definition from EST [RFC7030], here on the example of simple
   enrollment: "/.well-known/est/simpleenroll".  This approach is
   generalized to the following notation: "/.well-known/<enrollment-
   protocol>/<request>" in which <enrollment-protocol> refers to a
   certificate enrollment protocol.  Note that enrollment is considered
   here a message sequence that contains at least a certification
   request and a certification response.  The following conventions are
   used to provide maximal compatibility with BRSKI:

   *  <enrollment-protocol>: MUST reference the protocol being used.
      Existing values include EST [RFC7030] as in BRSKI and CMP as in
      [I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile] and Section 5.1 below.
      Values for other existing protocols such as CMC and SCEP, or for
      newly defined protocols, require their own specifications for
      their use of the <enrollment-protocol> and <request> URI
      components and are outside the scope of this document.

   *  <request>: if present, this path component MUST describe,
      depending on the enrollment protocol being used, the operation
      requested.  Enrollment protocols are expected to define their
      request endpoints, as done by existing protocols (see also
      Section 5).

   Well-known URIs for various endpoints on the domain registrar are
   already defined as part of the base BRSKI specification or indirectly
   by EST.  In addition, alternative enrollment endpoints MAY be
   supported at the registrar.

   A pledge SHOULD use the endpoints defined for the enrollment
   protocol(s) that it is capable of.  It will recognize whether its
   preferred protocol or the request that it tries to perform is
   supported by the domain registrar by sending a request to its
   preferred enrollment endpoint according to the above addressing
   scheme and evaluating the HTTP status code in the response.

   The following list of endpoints provides an illustrative example for
   a domain registrar supporting several options for EST as well as for
   CMP to be used in BRSKI-AE.  The listing contains the supported
   endpoints to which the pledge may connect for bootstrapping.  This
   includes the voucher handling as well as the enrollment endpoints.
   The CMP-related enrollment endpoints are defined as well-known URIs
   in CMP Updates [I-D.ietf-lamps-cmp-updates] and the Lightweight CMP
   Profile [I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile].

5.  Instantiation to Existing Enrollment Protocols

   This section maps the requirements to support proof of possession and
   proof of identity to selected existing enrollment protocols and
   provides further aspects of instantiating them in BRSKI-AE.

5.1.  BRSKI-CMP: Instantiation to CMP

   Instead of referring to CMP as specified in [RFC4210] and
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-cmp-updates], this document refers to the Lightweight
   CMP Profile [I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile] because the
   subset of CMP defined there is sufficient for the functionality
   needed here.

   When using CMP, the following specific implementation requirements
   apply (cf.  Figure 3).

   *  CA Certs Request

      -  Requesting CA certificates over CMP is OPTIONAL.
         If supported, it SHALL be implemented as specified in
         [I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile], Section 4.3.1.

   *  Attribute Request

      -  Requesting certificate request attributes over CMP is OPTIONAL.
         If supported, it SHALL be implemented as specified in
         [I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile], Section 4.3.3.
         Note that alternatively the registrar MAY modify the contents
         of requested certificate contents as specified in
         [I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile], Section 5.2.3.2.

   *  Certificate Request

      -  Proof of possession SHALL be provided as defined in the
         Lightweight CMP Profile
         [I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile], Section 4.1.1 (based

         on CRMF) or [I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile],
         Section 4.1.4 (based on PKCS#10).
         In certificate response messages the caPubs field, which
         generally in CMP may convey CA certificates to the requester,
         SHOULD NOT be used.

      -  Proof of identity SHALL be provided by using signature-based
         protection of the certification request message as outlined in
         [I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile], Section 3.2 using the
         IDevID secret.

   *  Certificate Confirm

      -  Explicit confirmation of new certificates to the RA/CA MAY be
         used as specified in the Lightweight CMP Profile
         [I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile], Section 4.1.1.
         Note that independently of certificate confirmation within CMP,
         enrollment status telemetry with the registrar will be
         performed as described in BRSKI [RFC8995], Section 5.9.4.

   *  If delayed delivery of responses (for instance, to support
      asynchronous enrollment) within CMP is needed, it SHALL be
      performed as specified in the Lightweight CMP Profile
      [I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile], Section 4.4 and
      [I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile], Section 5.1.2.

   *  Due to the use of self-contained signed request messages providing
      end-to-end security and the general independence of CMP of message
      transfer, the way in which messages are exchanged by the registrar
      with backend PKI (RA/CA) components is out of scope of this
      document.  It can be freely chosen according to the needs of the
      application scenario (e.g., using HTTP).  CMP Updates
      [I-D.ietf-lamps-cmp-updates] and the Lightweight CMP Profile
      [I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile] provide requirements for
      interoperability.

   BRSKI-AE with CMP can also be combined with Constrained BRSKI
   [I-D.ietf-anima-constrained-voucher], using CoAP for enrollment
   message transport as described by CoAP Transport for CMPV2
   [I-D.ietf-ace-cmpv2-coap-transport].  In this scenario, of course the
   EST-specific parts of [I-D.ietf-anima-constrained-voucher] do not
   apply.

5.2.  Other Instantiations of BRSKI-AE

   Further instantiations of BRSKI-AE can be done.  They are left for
   future work.

   In particular, CMC [RFC5272] (using its in-band source authentication
   options) and SCEP [RFC8894] (using its 'renewal' option) could be
   used.

   The fullCMC variant of EST sketched in [RFC7030], Section 2.5 might
   also be used here.  For EST-fullCMC further specification is
   necessary.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require IANA actions.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations as laid out in BRSKI [RFC8995] apply for
   the discovery and voucher exchange as well as for the status exchange
   information.

   The security considerations as laid out in the Lightweight CMP
   Profile [I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile] apply as far as CMP
   is used.

Appendix A.  Using EST for Certificate Enrollment

   When using EST with BRSKI, pledges interact via TLS with the domain
   registrar, which acts both as EST server and as the PKI RA.  The TLS
   channel is mutually authenticated, where the pledge uses its IDevID
   certificate issued by its manufacturer.



von Oheimb, et al.        Expires 27 April 2023                [Page 27]

Internet-Draft                  BRSKI-AE                    October 2022


   Using BRSKI-EST has the advantage that the mutually authenticated TLS
   channel established between the pledge and the registrar can be
   reused for protecting the message exchange needed for enrolling the
   LDevID certificate.  This strongly simplifies the implementation of
   the enrollment message exchange.

   Yet the use of TLS has the limitation that this cannot provide
   auditability nor end-to-end authentication of the CSR by the pledge
   at a remote PKI RA/CA because the TLS session is transient and
   terminates at the registrar.  This is a problem in particular if the
   enrollment is done via multiple hops, part of which may not even be
   network-based.

   With enrollment protocols that use for CSRs self-contained signed
   objects, logs of CSRs can be audited because CSRs can be third-party
   authenticated in retrospect, whereas TLS connections can not.

   Furthermore, the BRSKI registrars in each site have to be hardened so
   that they can be trusted to be the TLS initiator of the EST
   connection to the PKI RA/CA, and in result, their keying material
   needs to be managed with more security care than that of pledges
   because of trust requirements, for example they need to have the id-
   kp-cmcRA extended key usage attribute according to [RFC7030], see
   [RFC6402].  Impairment to a BRSKI registrar can result in arbitrarily
   many fake certificate registrations because real authentication and
   authorization checks can then be circumvented.

   Relying on TLS authentication of the TLS client, which is supposed to
   be the certificate requester, for a strong proof of origin for the
   CSR is conceptually non-trivial and can have implementation
   challenges.  EST has the option to include in the certification
   request, which is a PKCS#10 CSR, the so-called tls-unique value
   [RFC5929] of the underlying TLS channel.  This binding of the proof
   of identity of the TLS client to the proof of possession for the
   private key requires specific support by TLS implementations.

   The registrar terminates the security association with the pledge at
   TLS level and thus the binding between the certification request and
   the authentication of the pledge.  In BRSKI [RFC8995], the registrar
   typically doubles as the PKI RA and thus also authenticates the CSR
   and filters/denies requests from non-authorized pledges.  If the
   registrar cannot do the final authorization checks on the CSR and
   needs to forward it to the PKI RA, there is no end-to-end proof of
   identity and thus the decision of the PKI RA must trust on the pledge
   authentication performed by the registrar.  If successfully
   authorized, the CSR is passed to the PKI CA, which will issue the
   domain-specific certificate (LDevID).  If in this setup the protocol
   between the on-site registrar and the remote PKI RA is also EST, this

Internet-Draft                  BRSKI-AE                    October 2022


   approach requires online or at least intermittent connectivity
   between registrar and PKI RA, as well as availability of the PKI RA
   for performing the final authorization decision on the certification
   request.

   A further limitation of using EST as the certificate enrollment
   protocol is that due to using PKCS#10 structures in enrollment
   requests, the only possible proof-of-possession method is a self-
   signature, which excludes requesting certificates for key types that
   do not support signing.  CMP, for instance, has special proof-of-
   possession options for key agreement and KEM keys, see [RFC4210],
   Section 5.2.8.

Appendix B.  Application Examples

   This informative annex provides some detail to the application
   examples listed in Section 1.3.

B.1.  Rolling Stock

   Rolling stock or railroad cars contain a variety of sensors,
   actuators, and controllers, which communicate within the railroad car
   but also exchange information between railroad cars building a train,
   with track-side equipment, and/or possibly with backend systems.
   These devices are typically unaware of backend system connectivity.
   Managing certificates may be done during maintenance cycles of the
   railroad car, but can already be prepared during operation.
   Preparation will include generating certification requests, which are
   collected and later forwarded for processing, once the railroad car
   is connected to the operator backend.  The authorization of the
   certification request is then done based on the operator's asset/
   inventory information in the backend.

   UNISIG has included a CMP profile for enrollment of TLS client and
   server X.509 certificates of on-board and track-side components in
   the Subset-137 specifying the ETRAM/ETCS on-line key management for
   train control systems [UNISIG-Subset-137].

B.2.  Building Automation

   In building automation scenarios, a detached building or the basement
   of a building may be equipped with sensors, actuators, and
   controllers that are connected with each other in a local network but
   with only limited or no connectivity to a central building management
   system.  This problem may occur during installation time but also
   during operation.  In such a situation a service technician collects
   the necessary data and transfers it between the local network and the
   central building management system, e.g., using a laptop or a mobile



von Oheimb, et al.        Expires 27 April 2023                [Page 29]

Internet-Draft                  BRSKI-AE                    October 2022


   phone.  This data may comprise parameters and settings required in
   the operational phase of the sensors/actuators, like a component
   certificate issued by the operator to authenticate against other
   components and services.

   The collected data may be provided by a domain registrar already
   existing in the local network.  In this case connectivity to the
   backend PKI may be facilitated by the service technician's laptop.
   Alternatively, the data can also be collected from the pledges
   directly and provided to a domain registrar deployed in a different
   network as preparation for the operational phase.  In this case,
   connectivity to the domain registrar may also be facilitated by the
   service technician's laptop.

B.3.  Substation Automation

   In electrical substation automation scenarios, a control center
   typically hosts PKI services to issue certificates for Intelligent
   Electronic Devices operated in a substation.  Communication between
   the substation and control center is performed through a
   proxy/gateway/DMZ, which terminates protocol flows.  Note that
   [NERC-CIP-005-5] requires inspection of protocols at the boundary of
   a security perimeter (the substation in this case).  In addition,
   security management in substation automation assumes central support
   of several enrollment protocols in order to support the various
   capabilities of IEDs from different vendors.  The IEC standard
   IEC62351-9 [IEC-62351-9] specifies for the infrastructure side
   mandatory support of two enrollment protocols: SCEP [RFC8894] and EST
   [RFC7030], while an Intelligent Electronic Device may support only
   one of them.

B.4.  Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure

   For electric vehicle charging infrastructure, protocols have been
   defined for the interaction between the electric vehicle and the
   charging point (e.g., ISO 15118-2 [ISO-IEC-15118-2]) as well as
   between the charging point and the charging point operator (e.g.
   OCPP [OCPP]).  Depending on the authentication model, unilateral or
   mutual authentication is required.  In both cases the charging point
   uses an X.509 certificate to authenticate itself in TLS channels
   between the electric vehicle and the charging point.  The management
   of this certificate depends, among others, on the selected backend
   connectivity protocol.  In the case of OCPP, this protocol is meant
   to be the only communication protocol between the charging point and
   the backend, carrying all information to control the charging
   operations and maintain the charging point itself.  This means that
   the certificate management needs to be handled in-band of OCPP.  This
   requires the ability to encapsulate the certificate management

   messages in a transport-independent way.  Authenticated self-
   containment will support this by allowing the transport without a
   separate enrollment protocol, binding the messages to the identity of
   the communicating endpoints.

B.5.  Infrastructure Isolation Policy

   This refers to any case in which network infrastructure is normally
   isolated from the Internet as a matter of policy, most likely for
   security reasons.  In such a case, limited access to external PKI
   services will be allowed in carefully controlled short periods of
   time, for example when a batch of new devices is deployed, and
   forbidden or prevented at other times.

B.6.  Sites with Insufficient Level of Operational Security

   The RA performing (at least part of) the authorization of a
   certification request is a critical PKI component and therefore
   requires higher operational security than components utilizing the
   issued certificates for their security features.  CAs may also demand
   higher security in the registration procedures from RAs, which domain
   registrars with co-located RAs may not be able to fulfill.
   Especially the CA/Browser forum currently increases the security
   requirements in the certificate issuance procedures for publicly
   trusted certificates, i.e., those placed in trust stores of browsers,
   which may be used to connect with devices in the domain.  In case the
   on-site components of the target domain cannot be operated securely
   enough for the needs of an RA, this service should be transferred to
   an off-site backend component that has a sufficient level of
   security.

      -  many editorial improvements and clarifications as suggested,
         such as the comparison to plain BRSKI, the description of
         offline vs. synchronous message transfer and enrollment, and
         better differentiation of RA flavors.

      -  clarify that for transporting certificate enrollment messages
         between pledge and registrar, the TLS channel established
         between these two (via the join proxy) is used and the
         enrollment protocol MUST support this.

      -  clarify that the enrollment protocol chosen between pledge and
         registrar MUST also be used for the upstream enrollment
         exchange with the PKI.

      -  extend the description and requirements on how during the
         certificate enrollment phase the registrar MAY handle requests
         by the pledge itself and otherwise MUST forward them to the PKI
         and forward responses to the pledge.

   *  Change "The registrar MAY offer different enrollment protocols" to
      "The registrar MUST support at least one certificate enrollment
      protocol ..."

   *  In response to review by Michael Richardson,

      -  slightly improve the structuring of the Message Exchange
         Section 4.2 and add some detail on the request/response
         exchanges for the enrollment phase

      -  merge the 'Enhancements to the Addressing Scheme' Section 4.3
         with the subsequent one: 'Domain Registrar Support of
         Alternative Enrollment Protocols'

      BRSKI

   *  Include venue information

   From IETF draft 05 -> IETF draft ae-01:

   *  Renamed the repo and files from anima-brski-async-enroll to anima-
      brski-ae

   *  Added graphics for abstract protocol overview as suggested by
      Toerless Eckert

   *  Balanced (sub-)sections and their headers

   *  Added details on CMP instance, now called BRSKI-CMP

   From IETF draft 04 -> IETF draft 05:

   *  David von Oheimb became the editor.

   *  Streamline wording, consolidate terminology, improve grammar, etc.

   *  Shift the emphasis towards supporting alternative enrollment
      protocols.

   *  Update the title accordingly - preliminary change to be approved.

   *  Move comments on EST and detailed application examples to
      informative annex.

   *  Move the remaining text of section 3 as two new sub-sections of
      section 1.

   From IETF draft 03 -> IETF draft 04:

   *  Moved UC2-related parts defining the pledge in responder mode to a
      separate document.  This required changes and adaptations in
      several sections.  Main changes concerned the removal of the
      subsection for UC2 as well as the removal of the YANG model
      related text as it is not applicable in UC1.

   *  Updated references to the Lightweight CMP Profile.

   *  Added David von Oheimb as co-author.

   From IETF draft 02 -> IETF draft 03:

   *  Housekeeping, deleted open issue regarding YANG voucher-request in
      UC2 as voucher-request was enhanced with additional leaf.

   *  Included open issues in YANG model in UC2 regarding assertion
      value agent-proximity and CSR encapsulation using SZTP sub
      module).

   From IETF draft 01 -> IETF draft 02:

   *  Defined call flow and objects for interactions in UC2.  Object
      format based on draft for JOSE signed voucher artifacts and
      aligned the remaining objects with this approach in UC2 .

   *  Terminology change: issue #2 pledge-agent -> registrar-agent to
      better underline agent relation.

   *  Terminology change: issue #3 PULL/PUSH -> pledge-initiator-mode
      and pledge-responder-mode to better address the pledge operation.

   *  Communication approach between pledge and registrar-agent changed
      by removing TLS-PSK (former section TLS establishment) and
      associated references to other drafts in favor of relying on
      higher layer exchange of signed data objects.  These data objects
      are included also in the pledge-voucher-request and lead to an
      extension of the YANG module for the voucher-request (issue #12).

   *  Details on trust relationship between registrar-agent and
      registrar (issue #4, #5, #9) included in UC2.

   *  Recommendation regarding short-lived certificates for registrar-
      agent authentication towards registrar (issue #7) in the security
      considerations.

   *  Introduction of reference to agent signing certificate using SKID
      in agent signed data (issue #11).

   *  Enhanced objects in exchanges between pledge and registrar-agent
      to allow the registrar to verify agent-proximity to the pledge
      (issue #1) in UC2.

   *  Details on trust relationship between registrar-agent and pledge
      (issue #5) included in UC2.

   *  Split of use case 2 call flow into sub sections in UC2.

   From IETF draft 00 -> IETF draft 01:

   *  Update of scope in Section 1.2 to include in which the pledge acts
      as a server.  This is one main motivation for use case 2.

   *  Rework of use case 2 to consider the transport between the pledge
      and the pledge-agent.  Addressed is the TLS channel establishment
      between the pledge-agent and the pledge as well as the endpoint
      definition on the pledge.

   *  First description of exchanged object types (needs more work)

   *  Clarification in discovery options for enrollment endpoints at the
      domain registrar based on well-known endpoints in Section 4.3 do
      not result in additional /.well-known URIs.  Update of the
      illustrative example.  Note that the change to /brski for the
      voucher-related endpoints has been taken over in the BRSKI main
      document.

   *  Updated references.

   *  Included Thomas Werner as additional author for the document.

   From individual version 03 -> IETF draft 00:

   *  Inclusion of discovery options of enrollment endpoints at the
      domain registrar based on well-known endpoints in Section 4.3 as
      replacement of section 5.1.3 in the individual draft.  This is
      intended to support both use cases in the document.  An
      illustrative example is provided.

   *  Missing details provided for the description and call flow in
      pledge-agent use case UC2, e.g. to accommodate distribution of CA
      certificates.

   *  Updated CMP example in Section 5 to use Lightweight CMP instead of
      CMP, as the draft already provides the necessary /.well-known
      endpoints.

   *  Requirements discussion moved to separate section in Section 3.
      Shortened description of proof-of-identity binding and mapping to
      existing protocols.

   *  Removal of copied call flows for voucher exchange and registrar
      discovery flow from [RFC8995] in Section 4 to avoid doubling or
      text or inconsistencies.

   *  Reworked abstract and introduction to be more crisp regarding the
      targeted solution.  Several structural changes in the document to
      have a better distinction between requirements, use case
      description, and solution description as separate sections.
      History moved to appendix.

   From individual version 02 -> 03:

   *  Update of terminology from self-contained to authenticated self-
      contained object to be consistent in the wording and to underline
      the protection of the object with an existing credential.  Note
      that the naming of this object may be discussed.  An alternative
      name may be attestation object.

   *  Simplification of the architecture approach for the initial use
      case having an offsite PKI.

   *  Introduction of a new use case utilizing authenticated self-
      contain objects to onboard a pledge using a commissioning tool
      containing a pledge-agent.  This requires additional changes in
      the BRSKI call flow sequence and led to changes in the
      introduction, the application example,and also in the related
      BRSKI-AE call flow.

   *  Update of provided examples of the addressing approach used in
      BRSKI to allow for support of multiple enrollment protocols in
      Section 4.3.

   From individual version 01 -> 02:

   *  Update of introduction text to clearly relate to the usage of
      IDevID and LDevID.

   *  Definition of the addressing approach used in BRSKI to allow for
      support of multiple enrollment protocols in Section 4.3.  This
      section also contains a first discussion of an optional discovery
      mechanism to address situations in which the registrar supports
      more than one enrollment approach.  Discovery should avoid that
      the pledge performs a trial and error of enrollment protocols.

   *  Update of description of architecture elements and changes to
      BRSKI in Section 4.1.

   *  Enhanced consideration of existing enrollment protocols in the
      context of mapping the requirements to existing solutions in
      Section 3 and in Section 5.

   *  Update of examples, specifically for building automation as well
      as two new application use cases in Appendix B.

   *  Deletion of asynchronous interaction with MASA to not complicate
      the use case.  Note that the voucher exchange can already be
      handled in an asynchronous manner and is therefore not considered
      further.  This resulted in removal of the alternative path the
      MASA in Figure 1 and the associated description in Section 4.1.

   *  Enhancement of description of architecture elements and changes to
      BRSKI in Section 4.1.

   *  Consideration of existing enrollment protocols in the context of
      mapping the requirements to existing solutions in Section 3.

   *  New section starting Section 5 with the mapping to existing
      enrollment protocols by collecting boundary conditions.
