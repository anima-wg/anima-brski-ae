    <abstract>


<t>This document describes enhancements of bootstrapping a remote secure
key infrastructure (BRSKI, <xref target="RFC8995"/> ) to also operate
in domains featuring no or only timely limited connectivity between
involved components.
To support such
use cases, BRSKI-AE relies on the exchange of authenticated self-contained
objects (signature-wrapped objects) also for requesting and
distributing of domain specific device certificates.
The defined approach is agnostic regarding the utilized enrollment
protocol allowing the application of existing and potentially new
certificate management protocols.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>BRSKI as defined in <xref target="RFC8995"/> specifies a solution for
secure zero-touch (automated) bootstrapping of devices (pledges) in a
(customer) site domain. This includes the discovery of network elements
in the target domain, time synchronization, and the exchange of security
information necessary to establish trust between a pledge and the
domain. Security information about the target domain, specifically the
target domain certificate, is exchanged utilizing voucher objects as
defined in <xref target="RFC8366"/>.
These vouchers are authenticated self-contained (signed) objects, which
may be provided online (synchronous) or offline (asynchronous) via the
domain registrar to the pledge and originate from a Manufacturer's
Authorized Signing Authority (MASA).</t>

<t>For the enrollment of devices BRSKI relies on EST <xref target="RFC7030"/> to
request and distribute target domain
specific device certificates. EST in turn relies on a binding of the
certification request to an underlying TLS connection between the EST
client and the EST server. According to BRSKI the domain registrar acts
as EST server and is also acting as registration authority (RA) or
local registration authority (LRA).
The binding to TLS is used to protect the exchange of a certification
request (for a LDevID EE certificate) and to provide data origin
authentication (client identity information), to support the authorization
decision for processing the certification request. The TLS connection
is mutually authenticated and the client-side authentication utilizes
the pledge's manufacturer issued device certificate (IDevID certificate).
This approach requires an on-site availability of a local asset or
inventory management system performing the authorization decision based
on tuple of the certification request and the pledge authentication
using the IDevID certificate, to issue a domain specific certificate to
the pledge. The EST server (the domain registrar) terminates the security
association with the pledge and thus the binding between the
certification request and the authentication of the pledge via TLS.
This type of enrollment utilizing an online connection to the PKI
is considered as synchronous enrollment.</t>

<t>For certain use cases on-site support of a RA/CA component and/or an
asset management is not available and rather provided by an operator's
backend and may be provided timely limited or completely through
offline interactions.
This may be due to higher security requirements for operating the
certification authority or for optimization of operation for smaller
deployments to avoid the always on-site operation. The authorization of
a certification request based on an asset management in this case will
not / can not be performed on-site at enrollment time. Enrollment,
which cannot be performed in a (timely) consistent fashion is considered
as asynchronous enrollment in this document. It requires the support of
a store and forward functionality of certification request together
with the requester authentication (and identity) information. This
enables processing of the request at a later point in time.
A similar situation may occur through network segmentation, which is
utilized in industrial systems to separate domains with different
security needs. Here, a similar requirement arises if the communication
channel carrying the requester authentication is terminated before
the RA/CA authorization handling of the certification request. If a
second communication channel is opened to forward the certification
request to the issuing RA/ CA, the requester authentication information
needs to be retained and ideally bound to the certification request.
This uses case is independent from timely limitations of the first use
case. For both cases, it is assumed that the requester authentication
information is utilized in the process of authorization of a
certification request.
There are different options to perform store and forward of
certification requests including the requester authentication
information:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Providing a trusted component (e.g., an LRA) in the target
domain, which stores the certification request combined with
the requester authentication information (based on the IDevID)
and potentially the information about a successful proof of
possession (of the corresponding private key) in a way
prohibiting changes to the combined information.
Note that the assumption is that the information elements may
not be cryptographically bound together.
Once connectivity to the backend is available, the trusted
component forwards the certification request together with
the requester information (authentication and proof of
possession) to the off-site PKI for further processing.
It is assumed that the off-site PKI in this case relies on the
local pledge authentication result and thus performs the
authorization and issues the requested certificate.
In BRSKI the trusted component may be the EST server residing
co-located with the registrar in the target domain.</t>
  <t>Utilization of authenticated self-contained objects for the
enrollment, binding the certification request and the
requester authentication in a cryptographic way. This approach
reduces the necessary trust in a domain component to storage
and delivery. Unauthorized modifications of the requester
information (request and authentication) can be detected during
the verification of the authenticated self-contained object.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Focus of this document the support of handling authenticated
self-contained objects for bootstrapping. As it is intended to enhance
BRSKI it is named BRSKI-AE, where AE stands for asynchronous enrollment.
As BRSKI, BRSKI-AE results in the pledge storing an X.509 domain
certificate and sufficient information for verifying the domain
registrar / proxy identity (LDevID CA Certificate) as well as
domain specific X.509 device certificates (LDevID EE certificate).</t>

<t>The goal is to enhance BRSKI to be applicable to the additional use
cases. This is addressed by</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>enhancing the well-known URI approach with an additional path
for the utilized enrollment protocol.</t>
  <t>defining a certificate waiting indication and handling, if the
certifying component is (temporarily) not available.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Note that in contrast to BRSKI, BRSKI-AE assumes support of multiple
enrollment protocols on the infrastructure side, allowing the pledge
manufacturer to select the most appropriate. Thus, BRSKI-AE can be
applied for both, asynchronous and synchronous enrollment.</t>

<section anchor="scope-of-solution"><name>Scope of solution</name>

<section anchor="sup-env"><name>Supported environment</name>

<t>This solution is intended to be used in domains with limited support
of on-site PKI services and comprises use cases in which:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>there is no registration authority available in the target
domain. The connectivity to an off-site RA in an operator's
network may only be available temporarily. A local store and
forward device is used for the communication with the off-site
services.</t>
  <t>authoritative actions of a LRA are limited and may not comprise
authorization of certification requests of pledges. Final
authorization is done at the RA residing in the operator
domain.</t>
  <t>the target deployment domain already has an established
certificate management approach that shall be reused to (e.g.,
in brownfield installations).</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="app-examples"><name>Application Examples</name>

<t>The following examples are intended to motivate the support of
different enrollment approaches in general and asynchronous enrollment
specifically, by introducing industrial applications cases,
which could leverage BRSKI as such but also require support of
asynchronous operation as intended with BRSKI-AE.</t>

<section anchor="rolling-stock"><name>Rolling stock</name>

<t>Rolling stock or railroad cars contain a variety of sensors,
actuators, and controllers, which communicate within the railroad car
but also exchange information between railroad cars building a train,
or with a backend. These devices are typically unaware of backend
connectivity. Managing certificates may be done during maintenance
cycles of the railroad car, but can already be prepared during
operation. The preparation may comprise the generation of certification
requests by the components which are collected and forwarded for
processing, once the railroad car is connected to the operator backend.
The authorization of the certification request is then done based on
the operator's asset/inventory information in the backend.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="building-automation"><name>Building automation</name>

<t>In building automation, a use case can be described by a detached
building or the basement of a building equipped with sensor,
actuators, and controllers connected, but with only limited or no
connection to the centralized building management system. This
limited connectivity may be during the installation time but also
during operation time. During the installation in the basement, a
service technician collects the necessary information from the
basement network and provides them to the central building management
system, e.g., using a laptop or even a mobile phone to transport the
information. This information may comprise parameters and settings
required in the operational phase of the sensors/actuators, like a
certificate issued by the operator to authenticate against other
components and services.</t>

<t>The collected information may be provided by a domain registrar
already existing in the installation network. In this case
connectivity to the backend PKI may be facilitated by the service
technician's laptop.
Contrary, the information can also be collected from the
pledges directly and provided to a domain registrar deployed in a
different network. In this cases connectivity to the domain registrar
may be facilitated by the service technician's laptop.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="substation-automation"><name>Substation automation</name>

<t>In electrical substation automation a control center typically hosts
PKI services to issue certificates for Intelligent Electronic Devices
(IED)s operated in a substation. Communication between the substation
and control center is done through a proxy/gateway/DMZ, which
terminates protocol flows. Note that <xref target="NERC-CIP-005-5"/> requires
inspection of protocols at the boundary of a security
perimeter (the substation in this case).
In addition, security management in substation automation assumes
central support of different enrollment protocols to facilitate the
capabilities of IEDs from different vendors. The IEC standard
IEC62351-9 <xref target="IEC-62351-9"/> specifies the mandatory
support of two enrollment protocols, SCEP <xref target="RFC8894"/> and EST
<xref target="RFC7030"/> for the infrastructure side, while
the IED must only support one of the two.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure"><name>Electric vehicle charging infrastructure</name>

<t>For the electric vehicle charging infrastructure protocols have been
defined for the interaction between the electric vehicle (EV) and the
charging point (e.g., ISO 15118-2 <xref target="ISO-IEC-15118-2"/>)
as well as between the charging point and the charging point operator
(e.g. OCPP <xref target="OCPP"/>). Depending on the authentication
model, unilateral or mutual authentication is required. In both cases
the charging point uses an X.509 certificate to authenticate itself
in the context of a TLS connection between the EV and
the charging point. The management of this certificate depends
(beyond others) on the selected backend connectivity protocol.
Specifically, in case of OCPP it is intended as single communication
protocol between the charging point and the backend carrying all
information to control the charging operations and maintain the
charging point itself. This means that the certificate management is
intended to be handled in-band of OCPP. This requires to be able to
encapsulate the certificate management exchanges in a transport
independent way. Authenticated self-containment will ease this by
allowing the transport without a separate enrollment protocol. This
provides a binding of the exchanges to the identity of the
communicating endpoints.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="infrastructure-isolation-policy"><name>Infrastructure isolation policy</name>

<t>This refers to any case in which network infrastructure is normally
isolated from the Internet as a matter of policy, most likely for
security reasons. In such a case, limited access to external PKI
resources will be allowed in carefully controlled short periods of
time, for example when a batch of new devices are deployed, but
impossible at other times.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="less-operational-security-in-the-target-domain"><name>Less operational security in the target domain</name>

<t>The registration point performing the authorization of a certificate
request is a critical PKI component and therefore implicates higher
operational security than other components utilizing the issued
certificates for their security features. CAs may also demand higher
security in the registration procedures. Especially the CA/Browser
forum currently increases the security requirements in the certificate
issuance procedures for publicly trusted certificates.
There may be the situation that the target domain does not offer
enough security to operate a registration point and therefore wants
to transfer this service to a backend that offers a higher level of
operational security.</t>

</section>
</section>
</section>
<section anchor="req-sol"><name>Requirement discussion and mapping to solution elements</name>

<t>For the requirements discussion it is assumed that the domain
registrar receiving a certification request as authenticated
self-contained object is not the authorization point for this
certification request. If the domain registrar is the authorization
point and the pledge has a direct connection to the registrar,
BRSKI can be used directly. Note that BRSKI-AE could also be used
in this case.</t>

<t>Based on the intended target environment described in <xref target="sup-env"/> and
the motivated application examples
described in <xref target="app-examples"/> the following
base requirements are derived to support authenticated self-contained
objects as container carrying the certification request and further
information to support asynchronous operation.</t>

<t>At least the following properties are required:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Proof of Possession: proves to possess and control the private
key corresponding to the public key contained in the
certification request, typically by adding a signature using
the private key.</t>
  <t>Proof of Identity: provides data-origin authentication of a
data object, e.g., a certificate request, utilizing an existing
IDevID. Certificate updates may utilize the certificate that
is to be updated.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Solution examples (not complete) based on existing technology are
provided with the focus on existing IETF documents:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Certification request objects: Certification requests are
structures protecting only the integrity of the contained data
providing a proof-of-private-key-possession for locally
generated key pairs. Examples for certification requests are:  <list style="symbols">
      <t>PKCS#10 <xref target="RFC2986"/>: Defines a structure
for a certification request. The structure is signed to
ensure integrity protection and proof of possession of
the private key of the requester that corresponds to the
contained public key.</t>
      <t>CRMF <xref target="RFC4211"/>: Defines a structure for
the certification request message. The structure supports
integrity protection and proof of possession, through a
signature generated over parts of the structure by using
the private key corresponding to the contained public
key. CRMF also supports further proof-of-possession methods
for key pairs not capable to be used for signing.</t>
    </list>
Note that the integrity of the certification request is bound to
the public key contained in the certification request by
performing the signature operation with the corresponding
private key. In the considered application examples, this is
not sufficient to provide data origin authentication and needs to
be bound to the existing credential of the pledge (IDevID)
additionally. This binding supports the
authorization decision for the certification request through
the provisioning of a proof of identity. The binding of data
origin authentication to the certification request may be
delegated to the protocol used for certificate management.</t>
  <t>Proof of Identity options: The certification request should be
bound to an existing credential (here IDevID) to enable a proof
of identity and based on it an authorization of the certification
request.
The binding may be realized through security options in an
underlying transport protocol if the authorization of the
certification request is done at the next communication hop.
Alternatively, this binding can be done by a wrapping signature
employing an existing credential (initial: IDevID,
renewal: LDevID).
This requirement is addressed by existing enrollment protocols
in different ways, for instance:  <list style="symbols">
      <t>EST <xref target="RFC7030"/>: Utilizes PKCS#10 to
encode the certification request. The Certificate Signing
Request (CSR) may contain a binding to the underlying TLS
by including the tls-unique value in the self-signed CSR
structure. The tls-unique value is one result of the
TLS handshake. As the TLS handshake is performed mutually
authenticated and the pledge utilized its IDevID for it,
the proof of identity can be provided by the binding to
the TLS session. This is supported in EST using the
simpleenroll endpoint. To avoid the binding to the underlying
authentication in the transport layer, EST offers the
support of a wrapping the CSR with an existing certificate
by using Full PKI Request messages.</t>
      <t>SCEP <xref target="RFC8894"/>: Provides the
option to utilize either an existing secret (password) or
an existing certificate to protect the CSR based on
SCEP Secure Message Objects using CMS wrapping
(<xref target="RFC5652"/>). Note that the wrapping using
an existing IDevID credential in SCEP is referred to as
renewal. SCEP therefore does not rely on the security of
an underlying transport.</t>
      <t>CMP <xref target="RFC4210"/> Provides the option to
utilize either an existing secret (password) or an
existing certificate to protect the PKIMessage containing
the certification request. The certification request is
encoded utilizing CRMF. PKCS#10 is optionally supported.
The proof of identity of the PKIMessage containing the
certification request can be achieved by using IDevID
credentials to a PKIProtection carrying the actual signature
value. CMP therefore does not rely on the security of an
underlying transport protocol.</t>
      <t>CMC <xref target="RFC5272"/> Provides the option to
utilize either an existing secret (password) or an
existing certificate to protect the certification request
(either in CRMF or PKCS#10) based on CMS <xref target="RFC5652"/>).
Here a FullCMCRequest can
be used, which allows signing with an existing IDevID
credential to provide a proof of identity. CMC therefore
does not rely on the security of an underlying transport.</t>
    </list></t>
</list></t>

<t>Note that besides the already existing enrollment protocols there is
ongoing work in the ACE WG to define an encapsulation of EST messages in
OSCORE to result in a TLS independent way of protecting EST. This
approach <xref target="I-D.selander-ace-coap-est-oscore"/> may be
considered as further variant.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="architecture"><name>Architectural Overview and Communication Exchanges</name>

<t>To support asynchronous enrollment, the base system architecture
defined in BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/> is enhanced to facilitate support of 
alternative enrollment protocols. In general, the communication follows 
the BRSKI model and utilizes the existing BRSKI architecture elements.
The pledge initiates the communication with the domain registrar. 
Necessary enhancements to support authenticated self-contained objects
for certificate enrollment are kept on a minimum to ensure reuse of
already defined architecture elements and interactions.</t>

<t>For the authenticated self-contained objects used for the certification
request, BRSKI-AE relies on the defined message wrapping mechanisms
of the enrollment protocols stated in <xref target="req-sol"/> above.</t>

<section anchor="uc1"><name>Support of off-site PKI service</name>

<t>One assumption of BRSKI-AE is that the authorization of a
certification request is performed based on an authenticated
self-contained object, binding the certification request to the
authentication using the IDevID. This supports interaction with
off-site or off-line PKI (RA/CA) components.
In addition, the authorization of the certification request may not
be done by the domain registrar but by a PKI residing in the backend
of the domain operator (off-site) as described in <xref target="sup-env"/>.
Also, the certification request may be
piggybacked by another protocol. This leads to changes in the
placement or enhancements of the logical elements as shown in <xref target="uc1figure"/>.</t>

         "off-site domain" components
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The architecture overview in <xref target="uc1figure"/> utilizes
the same logical elements as BRSKI but with a different placement in
the deployment architecture for some of the elements.
The main difference is the placement of the PKI RA/CA component, which
is performing the authorization decision for the certification request
message. It is placed in the off-site domain of the operator (not
the deployment site directly), which may have no or only temporary
connectivity to the deployment or on-site domain of the pledge.
This is to underline the authorization decision for the certification
request in the backend rather than on-site.
The following list describes the components in the target domain:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Join Proxy: same functionality as described in BRSKI.</t>
  <t>Domain Registrar / Enrollment Proxy: In general the domain
registrar proxy has a similar functionality regarding the
imprinting of the pledge in the deployment domain to facilitate
the communication of the pledge with the MASA and the PKI.
Different is the authorization of the certification
request. BRSKI-AE allows to perform this in the operator's
backend (off-site), and not directly at the domain registrar.  <list style="symbols">
      <t>Voucher exchange: The voucher exchange with the MASA  via
the domain registrar is performed as described in BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/>.</t>
      <t>Certificate enrollment: For the pledge enrollment the
domain registrar in the deployment domain supports the
adoption of the pledge in the domain based on the voucher
request. Nevertheless, it may not have sufficient
information for authorizing the certification request.
If the authorization of the certification request is done
in the off-site domain, the domain registrar forwards the
certification request to the RA to perform the authorization.
Note that this requires, that the certification request object
is enhanced with a proof-of-identity to allow the authorization
based on the bound identity information of the pledge. As
stated above, this can be done by an additional signature
using the IDevID.
The domain registrar here acts as an enrollment proxy or
local registration authority. It is also able to handle the
case having no connection temporarily to an off-site PKI,
by storing the authenticated certification request and
forwarding it to the RA upon reestablished connectivity.
As authenticated self-contained objects are used, it
requires an enhancement of the domain registrar. This is
done by supporting alternative enrollment approaches
(protocol options, protocols, encoding) by enhancing the
addressing scheme to communicate with the domain registrar
(see <xref target="addressing"/>).</t>
    </list></t>
</list></t>

<t>The following list describes the vendor related components/service
outside the deployment domain:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>MASA: general functionality as described in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
Assumption is that the interaction with the MASA may be
synchronous (voucher request with nonce) or asynchronous
(voucher request without nonce).</t>
  <t>Ownership tracker: as defined in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The following list describes the operator related components/service
operated in the backend:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>PKI RA: Performs certificate management functions (validation
of certification requests, interaction with inventory/asset
management for authorization of certification requests, etc.)
for issuing, updating, and revoking certificates for a domain
as a centralized infrastructure for the domain operator.
The inventory (asset) management may be a separate component
or integrated into the RA directly.</t>
  <t>PKI CA: Performs certificate generation by signing the
certificate structure provided in the certification request.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Based on BRSKI and the architectural changes the original protocol
flow is divided into three phases showing commonalities and
differences to the original approach as depicted in the following.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Discovery phase (same as BRSKI)</t>
  <t>Voucher exchange with deployment domain registrar
(same as BRSKI).</t>
  <t>Enrollment phase (changed to support the application of
authenticated self-contained objects).</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="behavior-of-a-pledge"><name>Behavior of a pledge</name>

<t>The behavior of a pledge as described in <xref target="RFC8995"/> is kept with one exception.
After finishing the imprinting phase (4)
the enrollment phase (5) is performed with a method supporting
authenticated self-contained objects. Using EST with simple-enroll
cannot be applied here, as it binds the pledge authentication with
the existing IDevID to the transport channel (TLS) rather than to
the certification request object directly. This authentication in
the transport layer is not visible / verifiable at the authorization
point in the off-site domain. <xref target="exist_prot"/> discusses
potential enrollment protocols and options applicable.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="discovery"><name>Pledge - Registrar discovery and voucher exchange</name>

<t>The discovery phase is applied as specified in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="vexchange"><name>Registrar - MASA voucher exchange</name>

<t>The voucher exchange is performed as specified in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="enroll"><name>Pledge - Registrar - RA/CA certificate enrollment</name>

<t>As stated in <xref target="req-sol"/> the enrollment shall be
performed using an authenticated self-contained object providing
proof of possession and proof of identity.</t>

<t>The following list provides an abstract description of the flow
depicted in <xref target="enrollfigure"/>.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>CA Cert Request: The pledge <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> request the full distribution
of CA Certificates. This ensures that the pledge has the
complete set of current CA certificates beyond the
pinned-domain-cert (which may be the domain registrar certificate
contained in the voucher).</t>
  <t>CA Cert Response: Contains at least one CA certificate of
the issuing CA.</t>
  <t>Attribute Request: Typically, the automated bootstrapping occurs
without local administrative configuration of the pledge.
Nevertheless, there are cases, in which the pledge may also
include additional attributes specific to the deployment domain
into the certification request. To get these attributes in
advance, the attribute request <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be used.</t>
  <t>Attribute Response: Contains the attributes to be included
in the certification request message.</t>
  <t>Cert Request: Depending on the utilized enrollment protocol,
this certification request contains the authenticated
self-contained object ensuring both, proof-of-possession of the
corresponding private key and proof-of-identity of the
requester.</t>
  <t>Cert Response: certification response message containing the
requested certificate and potentially further information like
certificates of intermediary CAs on the certification path.</t>
  <t>Cert Waiting: waiting indication for the pledge to retry
after a given time. For this a request identifier is necessary.
This request identifier may be either part of the enrollment
protocol or build based on the certification request.</t>
  <t>Cert Polling: querying the registrar, if the certificate request
was already processed; can be answered either with another
Cert Waiting, or a Cert Response.</t>
  <t>Cert Confirm: confirmation message from pledge after receiving
and verifying the certificate.</t>
  <t>PKI/Registrar Confirm: confirmation message from PKI/registrar
about reception of the pledge's certificate confirmation.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The generic messages described above can implemented using various
protocols implementing authenticated self-contained objects,
as described in <xref target="req-sol"/>. Examples are available
in <xref target="exist_prot"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="addressing"><name>Addressing Scheme Enhancements</name>

<t>BRSKI-AE provides enhancements to the addressing scheme defined in <xref target="RFC8995"/> to
accommodate the additional handling of authenticated self-contained
objects for the certification request. As this is supported by
different enrollment protocols, they can be directly employed
(see also <xref target="exist_prot"/>).</t>

<t>The addressing scheme in BRSKI for client certificate request and
CA certificate distribution function during the enrollment uses
the definition from EST <xref target="RFC7030"/>, here on the
example on simple enroll: "/.well-known/est/simpleenroll"
This approach is generalized to the following notation:
"/.well-known/enrollment-protocol/request"
in which enrollment-protocol may be an already existing protocol or
a newly defined approach. Note that enrollment is considered here
as a sequence of at least a certification request and a certification
response. In case of existing enrollment protocols the following
notation is used proving compatibility to BRSKI:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>enrollment-protocol: references either EST <xref target="RFC7030"/> as in BRSKI or
CMP, CMC, SCEP, or newly defined approaches as alternatives.
Note: additional endpoints (well-known URI) at the registrar
may need to be defined by the utilized enrollment protocol.</t>
  <t>request: depending on the utilized enrollment protocol,
the request describes the required operation at the
registrar side. Enrollment protocols are expected to
define the request endpoints as done by existing protocols
(see also <xref target="exist_prot"/>).</t>
</list></t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="discovery_eo"><name>Domain registrar support of different enrollment options</name>

<t>Well-known URIs for different endpoints on the domain registrar are
already defined as part of the base BRSKI specification. In
addition, alternative enrollment endpoints may be supported at the
domain registrar. The pledge will recognize if its
supported enrollment option is supported by the domain registrar
by sending a request to its preferred enrollment endpoint.</t>

<t>The following provides an illustrative example for a domain
registrar supporting different options for EST as well as
CMP to be used in BRSKI-AE. The listing contains the supported
endpoints for the bootstrapping, to which the pledge may connect. This
includes the voucher handling as well as the enrollment endpoints.
The CMP related enrollment endpoints are defined as well-known URI
in CMP Updates <xref target="I-D.ietf-lamps-cmp-updates"/>
and the Lightweight CMP profile <xref target="I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile"/>.</t>

<section anchor="exist_prot"><name>Example for signature-wrapping using existing enrollment protocols</name>

<t>This section map the requirements to support proof of possession and
proof of identity to selected existing enrollment protocols.
Note that that the work in the ACE WG described in
<xref target="I-D.selander-ace-coap-est-oscore"/> may be considered
here as well, as it also addresses the encapsulation of EST in a way to
make it independent from the underlying TLS using OSCORE resulting in
an authenticated self-contained object.</t>

<section anchor="est-handling"><name>EST Handling</name>

<t>When using EST <xref target="RFC7030"/>, the following constraints
should be considered:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Proof of possession is provided by using the specified PKCS#10
structure in the request.</t>
  <t>Proof of identity is achieved by signing the certification
request object, which is only supported when Full PKI Request
(the /fullcmc endpoint) is used. This contains sufficient
information for the RA to make an authorization decision on the
received certification request.
Note: EST references CMC <xref target="RFC5272"/> for the
definition of the Full PKI Request. For proof of identity, the
signature of the SignedData of the Full PKI Request would be
calculated using the IDevID credential of the pledge.</t>
  <t>TBD RFC Editor: please delete /* TBD: in this case the binding to
the underlying TLS connection is not be necessary. */</t>
  <t>When the RA is not available, as per <xref target="RFC7030"/> Section 4.2.3, a
202 return code should be returned by the
Registrar. The pledge in this case would retry a simpleenroll
with a PKCS#10 request. Note that if the TLS connection is teared
down for the waiting time, the PKCS#10 request would need to be
rebuilt if it contains the unique identifier (tls_unique) from
the underlying TLS connection for the binding.</t>
  <t>TBD RFC Editor: please delete /* TBD: clarification of retry for
fullcmc is necessary as not specified in the context of EST */</t>

<section anchor="cmp-handling"><name>CMP Handling</name>

<t>Instead of using general CMP <xref target="RFC4210"/>, this specification
refers to the Lightweight CMP Profile
<xref target="I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile"/>, as it
restricts the full featured CMP to the functionality needed here.
For this, the following constrains should be observed:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>For proof of possession, the defined approach in Lightweight CMP Profile
<xref target="I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile"/> section 4.1.1 (based on CRMF)
and 4.1.4 (based on PCKS#10) should be supported.</t>
  <t>Proof of identity can be provided by using the signatures to
protect the certificate request message as outlined in section
3.2. of <xref target="I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile"/>.</t>
  <t>When the RA/CA is not available, a waiting indication should be
returned in the PKIStatus by the Registrar as specified in sections 4.4 and
5.1.2 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile"/> for delayed delivery.</t>
  <t>Requesting CA certificates and certificate request attributes should be

      <abstract>
	 <t>   This document contains a set of updates to the syntax and transport
   of Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) version 2.  This document
   updates RFC 4210 and RFC 6712.

   The aspects of CMP updated in this document are using EnvelopedData
   instead of EncryptedValue, clarifying the handling of p10cr messages,
   improving the crypto agility, as well as adding new general message
   types, extended key usages to identify certificates for use with CMP,
   and &#39;.well-known&#39; HTTP path segments.

   To properly differentiate the support of EnvelopedData instead of
   EncryptedValue, the CMP version 3 is introduced in case a transaction
   is supposed to use EnvelopedData.

   CMP version 3 is introduced to enable signaling support of
   EnvelopedData instead of EncryptedValue and signaling the use of an
   explicit hash AlgorithmIdentifier in certConf messages, as far as
   needed.

<abstract><t>This document specifies automated bootstrapping of an Autonomic Control Plane.  To do this, a Secure Key Infrastructure is bootstrapped.  This is done using manufacturer-installed X.509 certificates, in combination with a manufacturer's authorizing service, both online and offline.  We call this process the Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI) protocol. Bootstrapping a new device can occur when using a routable address and a cloud service, only link-local connectivity, or limited/disconnected networks. Support for deployment models with less stringent security requirements is included. Bootstrapping is complete when the cryptographic identity of the new key infrastructure is successfully deployed to the device.  The established secure connection can be used to deploy a locally issued certificate to the device as well.</t></abstract>

	 <t>   This document aims at simple, interoperable, and automated PKI
   management operations covering typical use cases of industrial and
   IoT scenarios.  This is achieved by profiling the Certificate
   Management Protocol (CMP), the related Certificate Request Message
   Format (CRMF), and HTTP-based or CoAP-based transport in a succinct
   but sufficiently detailed and self-contained way.  To make secure
   certificate management for simple scenarios and constrained devices
   as lightweight as possible, only the most crucial types of operations
   and options are specified as mandatory.  More special and complex use
   cases are supported as well, by features specified as recommended or
   optional.

<section anchor="app_history"><name>History of changes TBD RFC Editor: please delete</name>

<t>From IETF draft 03 -&gt; IETF draft 04:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Moved UC2 related parts defining the pledge in responder mode to a 
separate document. This required changes and adaptations in several 
sections. Main changes concerned the removal of the subsection for UC2 
as well as the removal of the YANG model related text as it is not 
applicable in UC1.</t>
  <t>Updated references to the Lightweight CMP Profile</t>
</list></t>

<t>From IETF draft 02 -&gt; IETF draft 03:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Housekeeping, deleted open issue regarding YANG voucher-request
in UC2 as voucher-request was enhanced with additional leaf.</t>
  <t>Included open issues in YANG model in UC2 regarding assertion
value agent-proximity and csr encapsulation using SZTP sub module).</t>
</list></t>

<t>From IETF draft 01 -&gt; IETF draft 02:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Defined call flow and objects for interactions in UC2. Object format
based on draft for JOSE signed voucher artifacts and aligned the
remaining objects with this approach in UC2 .</t>
  <t>Terminology change: issue #2 pledge-agent -&gt; registrar-agent to
better underline agent relation.</t>
  <t>Terminology change: issue #3 PULL/PUSH -&gt; pledge-initiator-mode
and pledge-responder-mode to better address the pledge operation.</t>
  <t>Communication approach between pledge and registrar-agent
changed by removing TLS-PSK (former section TLS establishment)
and associated references to other drafts in favor of relying on
higher layer exchange of signed data objects. These data objects
are included also in the pledge-voucher-request and lead to an
extension of the YANG module for the voucher-request (issue #12).</t>
  <t>Details on trust relationship between registrar-agent and
registrar (issue #4, #5, #9) included in UC2.</t>
  <t>Recommendation regarding short-lived certificates for
registrar-agent authentication towards registrar (issue #7) in
the security considerations.</t>
  <t>Introduction of reference to agent signing certificate using SKID
in agent signed data (issue #11).</t>
  <t>Enhanced objects in exchanges between pledge and registrar-agent
to allow the registrar to verify agent-proximity to the pledge
(issue #1) in UC2.</t>
  <t>Details on trust relationship between registrar-agent and
pledge (issue #5) included in UC2.</t>
  <t>Split of use case 2 call flow into sub sections in UC2.</t>
</list></t>

<t>From IETF draft 00 -&gt; IETF draft 01:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Update of scope in <xref target="sup-env"/> to include in
which the pledge acts as a server. This is one main motivation
for use case 2.</t>
  <t>Rework of use case 2 to consider the
transport between the pledge and the pledge-agent. Addressed is
the TLS channel establishment between the pledge-agent and the
pledge as well as the endpoint definition on the pledge.</t>
  <t>First description of exchanged object types (needs more work)</t>
  <t>Clarification in discovery options for enrollment endpoints at
the domain registrar based on well-known endpoints in
<xref target="discovery_eo"/> do not result in additional
/.well-known URIs. Update of the illustrative example.
Note that the change to /brski for the voucher related endpoints
has been taken over in the BRSKI main document.</t>
  <t>Updated references.</t>
  <t>Included Thomas Werner as additional author for the document.</t>
</list></t>

<t>From individual version 03 -&gt; IETF draft 00:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Inclusion of discovery options of enrollment endpoints at
the domain registrar based on well-known endpoints in
<xref target="discovery_eo"/> as replacement of section 5.1.3
in the individual draft. This is intended to support both use
cases in the document. An illustrative example is provided.</t>
  <t>Missing details provided for the description and call flow in
pledge-agent use case UC2, e.g. to
accommodate distribution of CA certificates.</t>
  <t>Updated CMP example in <xref target="exist_prot"/> to use
Lightweight CMP instead of CMP, as the draft already provides
the necessary /.well-known endpoints.</t>
  <t>Requirements discussion moved to separate section in
<xref target="req-sol"/>. Shortened description of proof
of identity binding and mapping to existing protocols.</t>
  <t>Removal of copied call flows for voucher exchange and registrar
discovery flow from <xref target="RFC8995"/> in <xref target="uc1"/> to avoid doubling or text or
inconsistencies.</t>
  <t>Reworked abstract and introduction to be more crisp regarding
the targeted solution. Several structural changes in the document
to have a better distinction between requirements, use case
description, and solution description as separate sections.
History moved to appendix.</t>
</list></t>

<t>From individual version 02 -&gt; 03:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Update of terminology from self-contained to authenticated
self-contained object to be consistent in the wording and to
underline the protection of the object with an existing
credential. Note that the naming of this object may be discussed.
An alternative name may be attestation object.</t>
  <t>Simplification of the architecture approach for the initial use
case having an offsite PKI.</t>
  <t>Introduction of a new use case utilizing authenticated
self-contain objects to onboard a pledge using a commissioning
tool containing a pledge-agent. This requires additional changes
in the BRSKI call flow sequence and led to changes in the
introduction, the application example,and also in the
related BRSKI-AE call flow.</t>
  <t>Update of provided examples of the addressing approach used in
BRSKI to allow for support of multiple enrollment protocols in
<xref target="addressing"/>.</t>
</list></t>

<t>From individual version 01 -&gt; 02:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Update of introduction text to clearly relate to the usage of
IDevID and LDevID.</t>
  <t>Definition of the addressing approach used in BRSKI to allow for
support of multiple enrollment protocols in <xref target="addressing"/>.  This
section also contains a first
discussion of an optional discovery mechanism to address
situations in which the registrar supports more than one enrollment
approach. Discovery should avoid that the pledge performs a trial
and error of enrollment protocols.</t>
  <t>Update of description of architecture elements and
changes to BRSKI in <xref target="architecture"/>.</t>
  <t>Enhanced consideration of existing enrollment protocols in the
context of mapping the requirements to existing solutions in
<xref target="req-sol"/> and in <xref target="exist_prot"/>.</t>
</list></t>

<t>From individual version 00 -&gt; 01:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Update of examples, specifically for building automation as
well as two new application use cases in <xref target="app-examples"/>.</t>
  <t>Deletion of asynchronous interaction with MASA to not
complicate the use case. Note that the voucher exchange can
already be handled in an asynchronous manner and is therefore
not considered further. This resulted in removal of the
alternative path the MASA in Figure 1 and the associated
description in <xref target="architecture"/>.</t>
  <t>Enhancement of description of architecture elements and
changes to BRSKI in <xref target="architecture"/>.</t>
  <t>Consideration of existing enrollment protocols in the context
of mapping the requirements to existing solutions in <xref target="req-sol"/>.</t>
  <t>New section starting <xref target="exist_prot"/> with the
mapping to existing enrollment protocols by collecting
boundary conditions.</t>
