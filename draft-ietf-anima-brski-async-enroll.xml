    <abstract>


<t>This document describes enhancements of bootstrapping a remote secure
key infrastructure (BRSKI, <xref target="RFC8995"/> ) to also operate
in domains featuring no or only timely limited connectivity between
involved components.
Further enhancements are provided to perform the BRSKI approach
in environments, in which the role of the pledge changes from a client
to a server . This changes the interaction model from a
pledge-initiator-mode to a pledge-responder-mode. To support both
use cases, BRSKI-AE relies on the exchange of authenticated self-contained
objects (signature-wrapped objects) also for requesting and
distributing of domain specific device certificates.
The defined approach is agnostic regarding the utilized enrollment
protocol allowing the application of existing and potentially new
certificate management protocols.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>BRSKI as defined in <xref target="RFC8995"/> specifies a solution for
secure zero-touch (automated) bootstrapping of devices (pledges) in a
(customer) site domain. This includes the discovery of network elements
in the target domain, time synchronization, and the exchange of security
information necessary to establish trust between a pledge and the
domain. Security information about the target domain, specifically the
target domain certificate, is exchanged utilizing voucher objects as
defined in <xref target="RFC8366"/>.
These vouchers are authenticated self-contained (signed) objects, which
may be provided online (synchronous) or offline (asynchronous) via the
domain registrar to the pledge and originate from a Manufacturer’s
Authorized Signing Authority (MASA).</t>

<t>For the enrollment of devices BRSKI relies on EST <xref target="RFC7030"/> to
request and distribute target domain
specific device certificates. EST in turn relies on a binding of the
certification request to an underlying TLS connection between the EST
client and the EST server. According to BRSKI the domain registrar acts
as EST server and is also acting as registration authority (RA) or
local registration authority (LRA).
The binding to TLS is used to protect the exchange of a certification
request (for a LDevID EE certificate) and to provide data origin
authentication (client identity information), to support the authorization
decision for processing the certification request. The TLS connection
is mutually authenticated and the client-side authentication utilizes
the pledge’s manufacturer issued device certificate (IDevID certificate).
This approach requires an on-site availability of a local asset or
inventory management system performing the authorization decision based
on tuple of the certification request and the pledge authentication
using the IDevID certificate, to issue a domain specific certificate to
the pledge. The EST server (the domain registrar) terminates the security
association with the pledge and thus the binding between the
certification request and the authentication of the pledge via TLS.
This type of enrollment utilizing an online connection to the PKI
is considered as synchronous enrollment.</t>

<t>For certain use cases on-site support of a RA/CA component and/or an
asset management is not available and rather provided by an operator’s
backend and may be provided timely limited or completely through
offline interactions.
This may be due to higher security requirements for operating the
certification authority or for optimization of operation for smaller
deployments to avoid the always on-site operation. The authorization of
a certification request based on an asset management in this case will
not / can not be performed on-site at enrollment time. Enrollment,
which cannot be performed in a (timely) consistent fashion is considered
as asynchronous enrollment in this document. It requires the support of
a store and forward functionality of certification request together
with the requester authentication (and identity) information. This
enables processing of the request at a later point in time.
A similar situation may occur through network segmentation, which is
utilized in industrial systems to separate domains with different
security needs. Here, a similar requirement arises if the communication
channel carrying the requester authentication is terminated before
the RA/CA authorization handling of the certification request. If a
second communication channel is opened to forward the certification
request to the issuing RA/ CA, the requester authentication information
needs to be retained and ideally bound to the certification request.
This uses case is independent from timely limitations of the first use
case. For both cases, it is assumed that the requester authentication
information is utilized in the process of authorization of a
certification request.
There are different options to perform store and forward of
certification requests including the requester authentication
information:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Providing a trusted component (e.g., an LRA) in the target
domain, which stores the certification request combined with
the requester authentication information (based on the IDevID)
and potentially the information about a successful proof of
possession (of the corresponding private key) in a way
prohibiting changes to the combined information.
Note that the assumption is that the information elements may
not be cryptographically bound together.
Once connectivity to the backend is available, the trusted
component forwards the certification request together with
the requester information (authentication and proof of
possession) to the off-site PKI for further processing.
It is assumed that the off-site PKI in this case relies on the
local pledge authentication result and thus performs the
authorization and issues the requested certificate.
In BRSKI the trusted component may be the EST server residing
co-located with the registrar in the target domain.</t>
  <t>Utilization of authenticated self-contained objects for the
enrollment, binding the certification request and the
requester authentication in a cryptographic way. This approach
reduces the necessary trust in a domain component to storage
and delivery. Unauthorized modifications of the requester
information (request and authentication) can be detected during
the verification of the authenticated self-contained object.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Focus of this document the support of handling authenticated
self-contained objects for bootstrapping. As it is intended to enhance
BRSKI it is named BRSKI-AE, where AE stands for asynchronous enrollment.
As BRSKI, BRSKI-AE results in the pledge storing an X.509 domain
certificate and sufficient information for verifying the domain
registrar / proxy identity (LDevID CA Certificate) as well as
domain specific X.509 device certificates (LDevID EE certificate).</t>

<t>Based on the proposed approach, a second set of scenarios can be
addressed, in which the pledge has either no direct communication path
to the domain registrar, e.g., due to missing network connectivity or a
different technology stack. In such scenarios the pledge is expected to
act as a server rather than a client. The pledge will be triggered to
generate request objects to be onboarded in the registrar’s domain.
For this, an additional component is introduced acting as an agent for
the domain registrar (registrar-agent) towards the pledge. This could
be a functionality of a commissioning tool or it may be even co-located
with the registrar.
In contrast to BRSKI the registrar-agent performs the object exchange
with the pledge and provides/retrieves data objects to/from the domain
registrar. For the interaction with the domain registrar the registrar
agent will use existing BRSKI endpoints.</t>

<t>The goal is to enhance BRSKI to be applicable to the additional use
cases. This is addressed by</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>enhancing the well-known URI approach with an additional path
for the utilized enrollment protocol.</t>
  <t>defining a certificate waiting indication and handling, if the
certifying component is (temporarily) not available.</t>
  <t>allowing to utilize credentials different from the pledge’s
IDevID to establish a TLS connection to the domain registrar,
which is necessary in case of using a registrar-agent.</t>
  <t>defining the interaction (dta exchange and data objects) between
a pledge acting as server an a registrar-agent and the domain
registrar.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Note that in contrast to BRSKI, BRSKI-AE assumes support of multiple
enrollment protocols on the infrastructure side, allowing the pledge
manufacturer to select the most appropriate. Thus, BRSKI-AE can be
applied for both, asynchronous and synchronous enrollment.</t>

</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="scope-of-solution" title="Scope of solution">

<section anchor="sup-env" title="Supported environment">

<t>This solution is intended to be used in domains with limited support
of on-site PKI services and comprises use cases in which:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>there is no registration authority available in the target
domain. The connectivity to an off-site RA in an operator’s
network may only be available temporarily. A local store and
forward device is used for the communication with the off-site
services.</t>
  <t>authoritative actions of a LRA are limited and may not comprise
authorization of certification requests of pledges. Final
authorization is done at the RA residing in the operator
domain.</t>
  <t>the target deployment domain already has an established
certificate management approach that shall be reused to (e.g.,
in brownfield installations).</t>
</list></t>

<t>In addition, the solution is intended to be applicable in domains
in which pledges have no direct connection to the domain registrar,
but are expected to be managed by the registrar. This can be motivated
by pledges featuring a different technology stack or by pledges without
an existing connection to the domain registrar during bootstrapping.
These pledges are likely to act in a server role. Therefore, the
pledge has to offer endpoints on which it can be triggered for
the generation of voucher-request objects and certification
objects as well as to provide the response objects to the pledge.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="app-examples" title="Application Examples">

<t>The following examples are intended to motivate the support of
different enrollment approaches in general and asynchronous enrollment
specifically, by introducing industrial applications cases,
which could leverage BRSKI as such but also require support of
asynchronous operation as intended with BRSKI-AE.</t>

<section anchor="rolling-stock" title="Rolling stock">

<t>Rolling stock or railroad cars contain a variety of sensors,
actuators, and controllers, which communicate within the railroad car
but also exchange information between railroad cars building a train,
or with a backend. These devices are typically unaware of backend
connectivity. Managing certificates may be done during maintenance
cycles of the railroad car, but can already be prepared during
operation. The preparation may comprise the generation of certification
requests by the components which are collected and forwarded for
processing, once the railroad car is connected to the operator backend.
The authorization of the certification request is then done based on
the operator’s asset/inventory information in the backend.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="building-automation" title="Building automation">

<t>In building automation, a use case can be described by a detached
building or the basement of a building equipped with sensor,
actuators, and controllers connected, but with only limited or no
connection to the centralized building management system. This
limited connectivity may be during the installation time but also
during operation time. During the installation in the basement, a
service technician collects the necessary information from the
basement network and provides them to the central building management
system, e.g., using a laptop or even a mobile phone to transport the
information. This information may comprise parameters and settings
required in the operational phase of the sensors/actuators, like a
certificate issued by the operator to authenticate against other
components and services.</t>

<t>The collected information may be provided by a domain registrar
already existing in the installation network. In this case
connectivity to the backend PKI may be facilitated by the service
technician’s laptop.
Contrary, the information can also be collected from the
pledges directly and provided to a domain registrar deployed in a
different network. In this cases connectivity to the domain registrar
may be facilitated by the service technician’s laptop.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="substation-automation" title="Substation automation">

<t>In electrical substation automation a control center typically hosts
PKI services to issue certificates for Intelligent Electronic Devices
(IED)s operated in a substation. Communication between the substation
and control center is done through a proxy/gateway/DMZ, which
terminates protocol flows. Note that <xref target="NERC-CIP-005-5"/> requires
inspection of protocols at the boundary of a security
perimeter (the substation in this case).
In addition, security management in substation automation assumes
central support of different enrollment protocols to facilitate the
capabilities of IEDs from different vendors. The IEC standard
IEC62351-9 <xref target="IEC-62351-9"/> specifies the mandatory
support of two enrollment protocols, SCEP <xref target="RFC8894"/> and EST
<xref target="RFC7030"/> for the infrastructure side, while
the IED must only support one of the two.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure" title="Electric vehicle charging infrastructure">

<t>For the electric vehicle charging infrastructure protocols have been
defined for the interaction between the electric vehicle (EV) and the
charging point (e.g., ISO 15118-2 <xref target="ISO-IEC-15118-2"/>)
as well as between the charging point and the charging point operator
(e.g. OCPP <xref target="OCPP"/>). Depending on the authentication
model, unilateral or mutual authentication is required. In both cases
the charging point uses an X.509 certificate to authenticate itself
in the context of a TLS connection between the EV and
the charging point. The management of this certificate depends
(beyond others) on the selected backend connectivity protocol.
Specifically, in case of OCPP it is intended as single communication
protocol between the charging point and the backend carrying all
information to control the charging operations and maintain the
charging point itself. This means that the certificate management is
intended to be handled in-band of OCPP. This requires to be able to
encapsulate the certificate management exchanges in a transport
independent way. Authenticated self-containment will ease this by
allowing the transport without a separate enrollment protocol. This
provides a binding of the exchanges to the identity of the
communicating endpoints.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="infrastructure-isolation-policy" title="Infrastructure isolation policy">

<t>This refers to any case in which network infrastructure is normally
isolated from the Internet as a matter of policy, most likely for
security reasons. In such a case, limited access to external PKI
resources will be allowed in carefully controlled short periods of
time, for example when a batch of new devices are deployed, but
impossible at other times.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="less-operational-security-in-the-target-domain" title="Less operational security in the target domain">

<t>The registration point performing the authorization of a certificate
request is a critical PKI component and therefore implicates higher
operational security than other components utilizing the issued
certificates for their security features. CAs may also demand higher
security in the registration procedures. Especially the CA/Browser
forum currently increases the security requirements in the certificate
issuance procedures for publicly trusted certificates.
There may be the situation that the target domain does not offer
enough security to operate a registration point and therefore wants
to transfer this service to a backend that offers a higher level of
operational security.</t>

</section>
</section>
</section>
<section anchor="req-sol" title="Requirement discussion and mapping to solution elements">

<t>For the requirements discussion it is assumed that the domain
registrar receiving a certification request as authenticated
self-contained object is not the authorization point for this
certification request. If the domain registrar is the authorization
point and the pledge has a direct connection to the registrar,
BRSKI can be used directly. Note that BRSKI-AE could also be used
in this case.</t>

<t>Based on the intended target environment described in <xref target="sup-env"/> and
the motivated application examples
described in <xref target="app-examples"/> the following
base requirements are derived to support authenticated self-contained
objects as container carrying the certification request and further
information to support asynchronous operation.</t>

<t>At least the following properties are required:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Proof of Possession: proves to possess and control the private
key corresponding to the public key contained in the
certification request, typically by adding a signature using
the private key.</t>
  <t>Proof of Identity: provides data-origin authentication of a
data object, e.g., a certificate request, utilizing an existing
IDevID. Certificate updates may utilize the certificate that
is to be updated.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Solution examples (not complete) based on existing technology are
provided with the focus on existing IETF documents:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Certification request objects: Certification requests are
structures protecting only the integrity of the contained data
providing a proof-of-private-key-possession for locally
generated key pairs. Examples for certification requests are:  <list style="symbols">
      <t>PKCS#10 <xref target="RFC2986"/>: Defines a structure
for a certification request. The structure is signed to
ensure integrity protection and proof of possession of
the private key of the requester that corresponds to the
contained public key.</t>
      <t>CRMF <xref target="RFC4211"/>: Defines a structure for
the certification request message. The structure supports
integrity protection and proof of possession, through a
signature generated over parts of the structure by using
the private key corresponding to the contained public
key. CRMF also supports further proof-of-possession methods
for key pairs not capable to be used for signing.</t>
    </list>
Note that the integrity of the certification request is bound to
the public key contained in the certification request by
performing the signature operation with the corresponding
private key. In the considered application examples, this is
not sufficient to provide data origin authentication and needs to
be bound to the existing credential of the pledge (IDevID)
additionally. This binding supports the
authorization decision for the certification request through
the provisioning of a proof of identity. The binding of data
origin authentication to the certification request may be
delegated to the protocol used for certificate management.</t>
  <t>Proof of Identity options: The certification request should be
bound to an existing credential (here IDevID) to enable a proof
of identity and based on it an authorization of the certification
request.
The binding may be realized through security options in an
underlying transport protocol if the authorization of the
certification request is done at the next communication hop.
Alternatively, this binding can be done by a wrapping signature
employing an existing credential (initial: IDevID,
renewal: LDevID).
This requirement is addressed by existing enrollment protocols
in different ways, for instance:  <list style="symbols">
      <t>EST <xref target="RFC7030"/>: Utilizes PKCS#10 to
encode the certification request. The Certificate Signing
Request (CSR) may contain a binding to the underlying TLS
by including the tls-unique value in the self-signed CSR
structure. The tls-unique value is one result of the
TLS handshake. As the TLS handshake is performed mutually
authenticated and the pledge utilized its IDevID for it,
the proof of identity can be provided by the binding to
the TLS session. This is supported in EST using the
simpleenroll endpoint. To avoid the binding to the underlying
authentication in the transport layer, EST offers the
support of a wrapping the CSR with an existing certificate
by using Full PKI Request messages.</t>
      <t>SCEP <xref target="RFC8894"/>: Provides the
option to utilize either an existing secret (password) or
an existing certificate to protect the CSR based on
SCEP Secure Message Objects using CMS wrapping
(<xref target="RFC5652"/>). Note that the wrapping using
an existing IDevID credential in SCEP is referred to as
renewal. SCEP therefore does not rely on the security of
an underlying transport.</t>
      <t>CMP <xref target="RFC4210"/> Provides the option to
utilize either an existing secret (password) or an
existing certificate to protect the PKIMessage containing
the certification request. The certification request is
encoded utilizing CRMF. PKCS#10 is optionally supported.
The proof of identity of the PKIMessage containing the
certification request can be achieved by using IDevID
credentials to a PKIProtection carrying the actual signature
value. CMP therefore does not rely on the security of an
underlying transport protocol.</t>
      <t>CMC <xref target="RFC5272"/> Provides the option to
utilize either an existing secret (password) or an
existing certificate to protect the certification request
(either in CRMF or PKCS#10) based on CMS <xref target="RFC5652"/>).
Here a FullCMCRequest can
be used, which allows signing with an existing IDevID
credential to provide a proof of identity. CMC therefore
does not rely on the security of an underlying transport.</t>
    </list></t>
</list></t>

<t>Note that besides the already existing enrollment protocols there is
ongoing work in the ACE WG to define an encapsulation of EST messages in
OSCORE to result in a TLS independent way of protecting EST. This
approach <xref target="I-D.selander-ace-coap-est-oscore"/> may be
considered as further variant.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="architecture" title="Architectural Overview and Communication Exchanges">

<t>To support asynchronous enrollment, the base system architecture
defined in BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/> is enhanced to facilitate the two target
use cases.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Use case 1 (Pledge-initiator-mode): the pledge requests
certificates from a PKI operated off-site via the domain
registrar.
The communication model follows the BRSKI model in which
the pledge initiates the communication.</t>
  <t>Use case 2 (Pledge-responder-mode): allows delegated
bootstrapping using a registrar-agent instead a direct
connection from the pledge to the domain registrar.
The communication model between registrar-agent and
pledge assumes that the pledge is acting as server and
responds to requests.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Both use cases are described in the next subsections. They utilize
the existing BRSKI architecture elements as much as possible.
Necessary enhancements to support authenticated self-contained objects
for certificate enrollment are kept on a minimum to ensure reuse of
already defined architecture elements and interactions.</t>

<t>For the authenticated self-contained objects used for the certification
request, BRSKI-AE relies on the defined message wrapping mechanisms
of the enrollment protocols stated in <xref target="req-sol"/> above.</t>

<section anchor="uc1" title="Use Case 1 (pledge-initiator-mode): Support of off-site PKI service">

<t>One assumption of BRSKI-AE is that the authorization of a
certification request is performed based on an authenticated
self-contained object, binding the certification request to the
authentication using the IDevID. This supports interaction with
off-site or off-line PKI (RA/CA) components.
In addition, the authorization of the certification request may not
be done by the domain registrar but by a PKI residing in the backend
of the domain operator (off-site) as described in <xref target="sup-env"/>.
Also, the certification request may be
piggybacked by another protocol. This leads to changes in the
placement or enhancements of the logical elements as shown in <xref target="uc1figure"/>.</t>

         "off-site domain" components
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The architecture overview in <xref target="uc1figure"/> utilizes
the same logical elements as BRSKI but with a different placement in
the deployment architecture for some of the elements.
The main difference is the placement of the PKI RA/CA component, which
is performing the authorization decision for the certification request
message. It is placed in the off-site domain of the operator (not
the deployment site directly), which may have no or only temporary
connectivity to the deployment or on-site domain of the pledge.
This is to underline the authorization decision for the certification
request in the backend rather than on-site.
The following list describes the components in the target domain:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Join Proxy: same functionality as described in BRSKI.</t>
  <t>Domain Registrar / Enrollment Proxy: In general the domain
registrar proxy has a similar functionality regarding the
imprinting of the pledge in the deployment domain to facilitate
the communication of the pledge with the MASA and the PKI.
Different is the authorization of the certification
request. BRSKI-AE allows to perform this in the operator’s
backend (off-site), and not directly at the domain registrar.  <list style="symbols">
      <t>Voucher exchange: The voucher exchange with the MASA  via
the domain registrar is performed as described in BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/>.</t>
      <t>Certificate enrollment: For the pledge enrollment the
domain registrar in the deployment domain supports the
adoption of the pledge in the domain based on the voucher
request. Nevertheless, it may not have sufficient
information for authorizing the certification request.
If the authorization of the certification request is done
in the off-site domain, the domain registrar forwards the
certification request to the RA to perform the authorization.
Note that this requires, that the certification request object
is enhanced with a proof-of-identity to allow the authorization
based on the bound identity information of the pledge. As
stated above, this can be done by an additional signature
using the IDevID.
The domain registrar here acts as an enrollment proxy or
local registration authority. It is also able to handle the
case having no connection temporarily to an off-site PKI,
by storing the authenticated certification request and
forwarding it to the RA upon reestablished connectivity.
As authenticated self-contained objects are used, it
requires an enhancement of the domain registrar. This is
done by supporting alternative enrollment approaches
(protocol options, protocols, encoding) by enhancing the
addressing scheme to communicate with the domain registrar
(see <xref target="addressing"/>).</t>
    </list></t>
</list></t>

<t>The following list describes the vendor related components/service
outside the deployment domain:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>MASA: general functionality as described in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
Assumption is that the interaction with the MASA may be
synchronous (voucher request with nonce) or asynchronous
(voucher request without nonce).</t>
  <t>Ownership tracker: as defined in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The following list describes the operator related components/service
operated in the backend:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>PKI RA: Performs certificate management functions (validation
of certification requests, interaction with inventory/asset
management for authorization of certification requests, etc.)
for issuing, updating, and revoking certificates for a domain
as a centralized infrastructure for the domain operator.
The inventory (asset) management may be a separate component
or integrated into the RA directly.</t>
  <t>PKI CA: Performs certificate generation by signing the
certificate structure provided in the certification request.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Based on BRSKI and the architectural changes the original protocol
flow is divided into three phases showing commonalities and
differences to the original approach as depicted in the following.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Discovery phase (same as BRSKI)</t>
  <t>Voucher exchange with deployment domain registrar
(same as BRSKI).</t>
  <t>Enrollment phase (changed to support the application of
authenticated self-contained objects).</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="behavior-of-a-pledge" title="Behavior of a pledge">

<t>The behavior of a pledge as described in <xref target="RFC8995"/> is kept with one exception.
After finishing the imprinting phase (4)
the enrollment phase (5) is performed with a method supporting
authenticated self-contained objects. Using EST with simple-enroll
cannot be applied here, as it binds the pledge authentication with
the existing IDevID to the transport channel (TLS) rather than to
the certification request object directly. This authentication in
the transport layer is not visible / verifiable at the authorization
point in the off-site domain. <xref target="exist_prot"/> discusses
potential enrollment protocols and options applicable.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="discovery" title="Pledge - Registrar discovery and voucher exchange">

<t>The discovery phase is applied as specified in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="vexchange" title="Registrar - MASA voucher exchange">

<t>The voucher exchange is performed as specified in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="enroll" title="Pledge - Registrar - RA/CA certificate enrollment">

<t>As stated in <xref target="req-sol"/> the enrollment shall be
performed using an authenticated self-contained object providing
proof of possession and proof of identity.</t>

<t>The following list provides an abstract description of the flow
depicted in <xref target="enrollfigure"/>.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>CA Cert Request: The pledge SHOULD request the full distribution
of CA Certificates. This ensures that the pledge has the
complete set of current CA certificates beyond the
pinned-domain-cert (which may be the domain registrar certificate
contained in the voucher).</t>
  <t>CA Cert Response: Contains at least one CA certificate of
the issuing CA.</t>
  <t>Attribute Request: Typically, the automated bootstrapping occurs
without local administrative configuration of the pledge.
Nevertheless, there are cases, in which the pledge may also
include additional attributes specific to the deployment domain
into the certification request. To get these attributes in
advance, the attribute request SHOULD be used.</t>
  <t>Attribute Response: Contains the attributes to be included
in the certification request message.</t>
  <t>Cert Request: Depending on the utilized enrollment protocol,
this certification request contains the authenticated
self-contained object ensuring both, proof-of-possession of the
corresponding private key and proof-of-identity of the
requester.</t>
  <t>Cert Response: certification response message containing the
requested certificate and potentially further information like
certificates of intermediary CAs on the certification path.</t>
  <t>Cert Waiting: waiting indication for the pledge to retry
after a given time. For this a request identifier is necessary.
This request identifier may be either part of the enrollment
protocol or build based on the certification request.</t>
  <t>Cert Polling: querying the registrar, if the certificate request
was already processed; can be answered either with another
Cert Waiting, or a Cert Response.</t>
  <t>Cert Confirm: confirmation message from pledge after receiving
and verifying the certificate.</t>
  <t>PKI/Registrar Confirm: confirmation message from PKI/registrar
about reception of the pledge’s certificate confirmation.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The generic messages described above can implemented using various
protocols implementing authenticated self-contained objects,
as described in <xref target="req-sol"/>. Examples are available
in <xref target="exist_prot"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="addressing" title="Addressing Scheme Enhancements">

<t>BRSKI-AE provides enhancements to the addressing scheme defined in <xref target="RFC8995"/> to
accommodate the additional handling of authenticated self-contained
objects for the certification request. As this is supported by
different enrollment protocols, they can be directly employed
(see also <xref target="exist_prot"/>).</t>

<t>The addressing scheme in BRSKI for client certificate request and
CA certificate distribution function during the enrollment uses
the definition from EST <xref target="RFC7030"/>, here on the
example on simple enroll: “/.well-known/est/simpleenroll”
This approach is generalized to the following notation:
“/.well-known/enrollment-protocol/request”
in which enrollment-protocol may be an already existing protocol or
a newly defined approach. Note that enrollment is considered here
as a sequence of at least a certification request and a certification
response. In case of existing enrollment protocols the following
notation is used proving compatibility to BRSKI:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>enrollment-protocol: references either EST <xref target="RFC7030"/> as in BRSKI or
CMP, CMC, SCEP, or newly defined approaches as alternatives.
Note: additional endpoints (well-known URI) at the registrar
may need to be defined by the utilized enrollment protocol.</t>
  <t>request: depending on the utilized enrollment protocol,
the request describes the required operation at the
registrar side. Enrollment protocols are expected to
define the request endpoints as done by existing protocols
(see also <xref target="exist_prot"/>).</t>
</list></t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="uc2" title="Use Case 2 (pledge-responder-mode): Registrar-agent communication with Pledges">

<t>To support mutual trust establishment of pledges, not directly
connected to the domain registrar. It relies on the exchange of
authenticated self-contained objects (the voucher request/response
objects as known from BRSKI and the enrollment request/response
objects as introduced by BRSKI-AE). This approach has also been applied
also for the use case 1.
This allows independence of a potential protection provided by the
used transport protocol.</t>

<t>In contrast to BRSKI, the object exchanges performed with the help of
a registrar-agent component, supporting the interaction of
the pledge with the domain registrar. It may be an integrated
functionality of a commissioning tool. This leads to enhancements
of the logical elements in the BRSKI architecture as shown in <xref target="uc2figure"/>.
The registrar-agent interacts with the pledge to acquire and to supply
the required data objects for bootstrapping, which are also exchanged
between the registrar-agent and the domain registrar.
Moreover, the addition of the registrar-agent
also influences the sequences for the data exchange between the pledge
and the domain registrar described in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
The general goal for the registrar-agent application is the reuse of
already defined endpoints of the domain registrar side. The
functionality of the already existing registrar endpoints may need
small enhancements.</t>

]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The architecture overview in <xref target="uc2figure"/> utilizes
the same logical components as BRSKI with the registrar-agent
component in addition.</t>

<t>For authentication towards the domain registrar, the registrar-agent
uses its LDevID. The provisioning of the registrar-agent LDevID may
be done by a separate BRSKI run or other means in advance. It is
recommended to use short lived registrar-agent LDevIDs in the range
of days or weeks.</t>

<t>If a registrar detects a request originates from a registrar-agent
it is able to switch the operational mode from BRSKI to BRSKI-AE.</t>

<t>In addition, the domain registrar may authenticate the user operating
the registrar-agent to perform additional authorization of a pledge
enrollment action. Examples for such user level authentication are
the application of HTTP authentication or the usage of authorization
tokens or other. This is out of scope of this document.</t>

<t>The following list describes the components in a (customer) site domain:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Pledge: The pledge is expected to respond with the necessary data
objects for bootstrapping to the registrar-agent.
The transport protocol used between the pledge and the
registrar-agent is assumed to be HTTP in the context of this
document. Other transport protocols may be used but are out of
scope of this document.
As the pledge is acting as a server during bootstrapping it
leads to some differences to BRSKI:  <list style="symbols">
      <t>Discovery of the domain registrar by the pledge is not needed
as the pledge will be triggered by the registrar-agent.</t>
      <t>Discovery of the pledge by the registrar-agent must be
possible.</t>
      <t>As the registrar-agent must be able to request data objects
for bootstrapping of the pledge, the pledge must offer
corresponding endpoints.</t>
      <t>The registrar-agent may provide additional data to the pledge,
in the context of the triggering request.</t>
      <t>Order of exchanges in the call flow may be different as
the registrar-agent collects both objects, pledge-voucher-request
objects and pledge-enrollment-request objects, at once and provides
them to the registrar. This approach may also be used to
perform a bulk bootstrapping of several devices.</t>
      <t>The data objects utilized for the data exchange between
the pledge and the registrar are self-contained authenticated
objects (signature-wrapped objects) as in use case 1 <xref target="uc1"/>.</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>Registrar-agent: provides a communication path to exchange
data objects between the pledge and the domain registrar.
The registrar-agent facilitates situations, in which the domain
registrar is not directly reachable by the pledge, either due
to a different technology stack or due to missing connectivity.
The registrar-agent triggers
the pledge to create bootstrapping information such as voucher
request objects and enrollment request objects from one or
multiple pledges at once and performs a bulk bootstrapping based
on the collected data.
The registrar-agent is expected to possess information of the
domain registrar, either by configuration or by using the
discovery mechanism defined in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
There is no trust assumption between the pledge and the
registrar-agent as only authenticated self-contained objects
are applied, which are transported via the registrar-agent and
provided either by the pledge or the registrar.
The trust assumption between the registrar-agent and the registrar
bases on an own LDevID of the registrar-agent, acting as registrar
component. This allows the registrar-agent to authenticate towards
the registrar. The registrar can utilize this authentication to
distinguish communication with a pledge from a registrar-agent
based on the exchanged objects.</t>
  <t>Join Proxy: same functionality as described in <xref target="RFC8995"/>. Note
that it may be used by the registrar-agent instead of the pledge
to find the registrar, if not configured.</t>
  <t>Domain Registrar: In general the domain registrar fulfills the
same functionality regarding the bootstrapping of the pledge in
a (customer) site domain by facilitating the communication of the
pledge with the MASA service and the domain PKI service. In
contrast to <xref target="RFC8995"/>, the
domain registrar does not interact with a pledge directly but
through the registrar-agent. The registrar detects if
the bootstrapping is performed by the pledge directly or by the
registrar-agent.
The manufacturer provided components/services (MASA and Ownership
tracker) are used as defined in <xref target="RFC8995"/>. For issuing
a voucher, the MASA may perform additional checks on voucher-request
objects, to issue a voucher indicating agent-proximity instead of
registrar-proximity.</t>
</list></t>

<t>[RFC Editor: please delete] /*</t>

<t>Open Issues: The voucher defined in <xref target="RFC8366"/> defines
the leaf assertion as enum, which cannot be extended. To define an
additional assertion RFC 8366 may be revised. */</t>

but it is an enum, and these seem to be intrinsically non-extensible even though the transport encodings would give us what we need, so it seems o be a yang process, but not encoding issue:
If we would amend the assertion with the new agent-proximity enum value, binary transport would indicate this as a new numerical value, and string transports would indicate this as the new string value "agent-proximity". In both cases, pre-exising voucher implementation would recognize an unrecognized values and would fail on the voucher, which is exactly what we want. Aka: if it was not for the fact that enum are not meant to be extensible, it seems there would be no issue ?
We are looking for YANG doctor guidance/recommendations for this issue, boh for how to deal with this extension, but also (ideally) with the best option how to minimize he overhead when the next assertion extension comes along. Ideally, the solution would allow us to automatically get a string value encoding for string transports and a numerical encoding vor binary transports. And new values would just require additions to a TBD IANA registry we would define into an appropriate draft.

<t>“Agent-proximity” is a weaker assertion then “proximity”.
In case of “agent-proximity” it is a statement, that the
proximity-registrar-certificate was provided via the registrar-agent
and not directly. This can be verified by the registrar and also by the
MASA through voucher-request processing. Note that at the time of
creating the voucher-request, the pledge cannot verify the
LDevID(Reg) EE certificate and has no proof-of-possession of the
corresponding private key for the certificate. Trust handover to the
domain is established via the “pinned-domain-certificate” in the
voucher.</t>

<t>In contrast, “proximity” provides a statement, that the pledge was in
direct contact with the registrar and was able to verify
proof-of-possession of the private key in the context of the TLS
handshake. The provisionally accepted LDevID(Reg) EE certificate can
be verified after the voucher has been processed by the pledge.</t>

<section anchor="pledge_ep" title="Behavior of a pledge in pledge-responder-mode">

<t>In contrast to use case 1 <xref target="uc1"/> the pledge acts as
a server component if data is triggered by the registrar-agent for
the generation of pledge-voucher-request and pledge-enrollment-request
objects as well as for the processing of the response objects and the
generation of status information.
Due to the use of the registrar-agent, the interaction with
the domain registrar is changed as shown in <xref target="exchangesfig_uc2_1"/>.
To enable interaction with the registrar-agent, the pledge provides
endpoints using the BRSKI interface based on the
“/.well-known/brski” URI tree.
The following endpoints are defined for the pledge in this document:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>/.well-known/brski/pledge-voucher-request: trigger pledge to
create voucher request. It returns the pledge-voucher-request.</t>
  <t>/.well-known/brski/pledge-enrollment-request: trigger pledge to
create enrollment request. it returns the pledge-enrollment-request.</t>
  <t>/.well-known/brski/pledge-voucher: supply MASA provided
voucher to pledge. It returns the pledge-voucher-status.</t>
  <t>/.well-known/brski/pledge-enrollment: supply enroll
response (certificate) to pledge. It returns the
pledge-enrollment-status.</t>
  <t>/.well-known/brski/pledge-CACerts: supply CACerts to
pledge (optional).</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="behavior-of-a-registrar-agent" title="Behavior of a registrar-agent">

<t>The registrar-agent is a new component in the BRSKI context. It
provides connectivity between the pledge and the domain registrar
and reuses the endpoints of the domain registrar side already
specified in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
It facilitates the exchange of data objects between the pledge and
the domain registrar, which are the voucher request/response objects,
the enrollment request/response objects, as well as related status
objects.
For the communication the registrar-agent utilizes communication
endpoints provided by the pledge.
The transport in this specification is based on HTTP but may also
be done using other transport mechanisms. This new component changes
the general interaction between the pledge and the domain registrar
as shown in <xref target="exchangesfig_uc2_2"/>.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent is expected to already possess an LDevID(RegAgt)
to authenticate towards the domain registrar. The registrar-agent
will use this LDevID(RegAgt) when establishing the TLS session
with the domain registrar in the context of for TLS client-side
authentication. The LDevID(RegAgt) certificate MUST include a
SubjectKeyIdentifier (SKID), which is used as reference in the
context of an agent-signed-data object. Note that this is an additional
requirement for issuing the certificate, as <xref target="IEEE-802.1AR"/> only requires the SKID to be included for intermediate CA certificates.
In the specific application of BRSKI-AE, it is used in favor of a
certificate fingerprint to avoid additional computations.</t>

<t>Using an LDevID for TLS client-side authentication is a deviation
from <xref target="RFC8995"/>,
in which the pledge’s IDevID credential is used to perform
TLS client authentication. The use of the LDevID(RegAgt) allows the
domain registrar to distinguish, if bootstrapping is initiated from a
pledge or from a registrar-agent and adopt the internal handling
accordingly.
As BRSKI-AE uses authenticated self-contained data objects between
the pledge and the domain registrar, the binding of the pledge
identity to the request object is provided by the data object
signature employing the pledge’s IDevID. The objects exchanged between
the pledge and the domain registrar used in the context of this
specifications are JOSE objects</t>

<t>In addition to the LDevID(RegAgt), the registrar-agent is provided
with the product-serial-numbers of the pledges to be bootstrapped.
This is necessary to allow the discovery of pledges by the
registrar-agent using mDNS. The list may be provided by administrative
means or the registrar agent may get the information via an interaction
with the pledge, like scanning of product-serial-number information
using a QR code or similar.</t>

<t>According to <xref target="RFC8995"/> section 5.3, the domain
registrar performs the pledge authorization for bootstrapping within
his domain based on the pledge voucher-request object.</t>

<t>The following information is therefore available at the registrar-agent:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>LDevID(RegAgt): own operational key pair.</t>
  <t>LDevID(reg) certificate: certificate of the domain registrar.</t>
  <t>Serial-number(s): product-serial-number(s) of pledge(s)
to be bootstrapped.</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="discovery_uc2_reg" title="Registrar discovery by the registrar-agent">

<t>The discovery of the domain registrar may be done as specified in
<xref target="RFC8995"/> with the
deviation that it is done between the registrar-agent and the domain
registrar. Alternatively, the registrar-agent may be configured
with the address of the domain registrar and the certificate
of the domain registrar.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="discovery_uc2_ppa" title="Pledge discovery by the registrar-agent">

<t>The discovery of the pledge by registrar-agent should be done
by using DNS-based Service Discovery <xref target="RFC6763"/> over Multicast DNS
<xref target="RFC6762"/> to discover the
pledge at “product-serial-number.brski-pledge._tcp.local.”
The pledge constructs a local host name based on device local
information (product-serial-number), which results in
“product-serial-number.brski-pledge._tcp.local.”. It can then be
discovered by the registrar-agent via mDNS. Note that other
mechanisms for discovery may be used.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent is able to build the same information based
on the provided list of product-serial-number.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="exchanges_uc2" title="Bootstrapping objects and corresponding exchanges">

<t>The interaction of the pledge with the registrar-agent may be
accomplished using different transport means (protocols and or
network technologies). For this document the usage of HTTP is
targeted as in BRSKI. Alternatives may be CoAP, Bluetooth Low
Energy (BLE), or Nearfield Communication (NFC). This requires
independence of the exchanged data objects between the pledge and
the registrar from transport security. Therefore, authenticated
self-contained objects (here: signature-wrapped objects) are applied
in the data exchange between the pledge and the registrar.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent provides the domain-registrar certificate
(LDevID(Reg) EE certificate) to the pledge to be included into
the “agent-provided-proximity-registrar-certificate” leaf in the
pledge-voucher-request object. This enables the registrar to verify,
that it is the target registrar for handling the request. The registrar
certificate may be configured at the registrar-agent or may be
fetched by the registrar-agent based on a prior TLS connection
establishment with the domain registrar.
In addition, the registrar-agent provides agent-signed-data containing
the product-serial-number in the body, signed with the LDevID(RegAgt).
This enables the registrar to verify and log, which registrar-agent was
in contact with the pledge.
Optionally the registrar-agent may provide its LDevID(RegAgt)
certificate to the pledge for inclusion into the pledge-voucher-request
as “agent-sign-cert” leaf.
Note that this may be omitted in constraint environments to safe
bandwidth between the registrar-agent and the pledge.
If not contained, the registrar-agent MUST fetch the LDevID(RegAgt)
certificate based on the SubjectKeyIdentifier (SKID) in the header
of the agent-signed-data. The registrar may include the LDevID(RegAgt)
certificate information into the registrar-voucher-request.</t>

<t>The MASA in turn verifies the LDevID(Reg) certificate is included
in the pledge-voucher-request (prior-signed-voucher-request) in the
“agent-provided-proximity-registrar-certificate” leaf and may assert
in the voucher “verified” or “logged”
instead of “proximity”, as there is no direct connection between the
pledge and the registrar.
If the LDevID(RegAgt) certificate is included contained in the “agent-sign-cert”
leave of the registrar-voucher-request, the MASA can verify the
LDevID(RegAgt) certificate and the signature of the registrar-agent
in the agent-signed-data provided in the prior-signed-voucher-request.
If both can be verified successfully, the MASA can assert
“agent-proximity” in the voucher. Otherwise, it may assert “verified”
or “logged”. The voucher can then be supplied via the registrar
to the registrar-agent.</t>

<t>The pledge SHOULD include this Content-Type header field indicating the
included media type for the voucher response. Note that this is also an 
indication regarding the acceptable fromat of the voucher response. 
This format is included by the registrar as described in <xref target="exchanges_uc2_2"/>.</t>

<t>Once the registrar-agent has received the pledge-voucher-request
it can trigger the pledge to generate an enrollment-request object.
As in BRSKI the enrollment request object is a PKCS#10,
additionally signed by the IDevID.
Note, as the initial enrollment aims to request a general certificate,
no certificate attributes are provided to the pledge.</t>

<t>Triggering the pledge to create the enrollment-request is done using
HTTP POST on the defined pledge endpoint
“/.well-known/brski/pledge-enrollment-request”.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent pledge-enrollment-request Content-Type header
is:</t>

<t>application/json:</t>

<t>with an empty body.</t>

<t>[RFC Editor: please delete] /*
error in v03: HTTP POST allows for an empty body but also to provide additional data, 
like CSR attributes or information about enroll type: initial or 
re-enroll. */</t>

<t>Upon receiving the enrollment-trigger, the pledge SHALL construct
the pledge-enrollment-request as authenticated self-contained object.
The CSR already assures proof of possession of the private key
corresponding to the contained public key. In addition, based on the
additional signature using the IDevID, proof of identity is provided.
Here, a JOSE object is being created in which the body utilizes
the YANG module for the CSR as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-sztp-csr"/>.</t>

<t>[RFC Editor: please delete] /*
Open Issues: Reuse of the sub-tree ietf-sztp-csr:csr may not be
possible as it is not the complete module. */</t>

<t>Depending on the capability of the pledge, it MAY construct the
enrollment request as plain PKCS#10.
Note that the focus here is placed on PKCS#10 as PKCS#10 can be
transmitted in different enrollment protocols like EST, CMP, CMS,
and SCEP. If the pledge is already implementing an enrollment
protocol, it may leverage that functionality for the creation of
the enrollment request object. Note also that
<xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-sztp-csr"/> also allows for inclusion
of certificate request objects from CMP or CMC.</t>

<t>The pledge SHOULD construct the pledge-enrollment-request as PKCS#10
object and sign it additionally with its IDevID credential. The
pledge-enrollment-request should be encoded as JOSE object.</t>

<t>[RFC Editor: please delete] /*
Open Issues: Depending on target environment, it may be useful to
assume that the pledge may already “know” its functional scope and
therefore the number of certificates needed during operation. As a
result, multiple CSRs may be generated to provide achieve multiple
certificates as a result of the enrollment. This would need further
description and potential enhancements also in the enrollment-request
object to transport different CSRs. */</t>

<t><xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-sztp-csr"/> considers PKCS#10 but
also CMP and CMC as certificate request format. Note that the wrapping
signature is only necessary for plain PKCS#10 as other request formats
like CMP and CMS support the signature wrapping as part of their own
certificate request format.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent enrollment-request Content-Type header for a
wrapped PKCS#10 is:</t>

<t>application/jose:</t>

<t>The header of the pledge enrollment-request SHALL contain the following
parameter as defined in <xref target="RFC7515"/>:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>alg: algorithm used for creating the object signature.</t>
  <t>x5c: contains the base64-encoded pledge IDevID certificate.</t>

<t>The body of the pledge enrollment-request object SHOULD contain a P10
parameter (for PKCS#10) as defined for ietf-sztp-csr:csr in
<xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-sztp-csr"/>:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>P10: contains the base64-encoded PKCS#10 of the pledge.</t>

<t>The JOSE object is signed using the pledge’s IDevID credential, which
corresponds to the certificate signaled in the JOSE header.</t>

<t>Once the registrar-agent has collected the pledge-voucher-request and
pledge-enrollment-request objects, it connects to the registrar
and sends the request objects. As the registrar-agent is intended
to work between the pledge and the domain registrar, a collection
of requests from more than one pledges is possible, allowing a bulk
bootstrapping of multiple pledges using the same connection between
the registrar-agent and the domain registrar.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent establishes a TLS connection with the
registrar. As already stated in <xref target="RFC8995"/>, the use
of TLS 1.3 (or newer) is encouraged.  TLS 1.2 or newer is REQUIRED
on the registrar-agent side.  TLS 1.3 (or newer) SHOULD be available
on the registrar, but TLS 1.2 MAY be used.  TLS 1.3 (or newer) SHOULD be
available on the MASA, but TLS 1.2 MAY be used.</t>

<t>In contrast to <xref target="RFC8995"/> client authentication is achieved by using
the LDevID(RegAgt) of the
registrar-agent instead of the IDevID of the pledge. This allows
the registrar to distinguish between pledge-initiator-mode and
pledge-responder-mode. In pledge-responder-mode the registrar
has no direct connection to the pledge but via the registrar-agent.
The registrar can receive request objects in different forms as
defined in <xref target="RFC8995"/>. Specifically,
the registrar will receive JOSE objects from the pledge for
voucher-request and enrollment-request (instead of the objects for
voucher-request (CMS-signed JSON) and enrollment-request (PKCS#10).</t>

<t>The registrar-agent sends the pledge-voucher-request to the
registrar with an HTTPS POST to the endpoint
“/.well-known/brski/requestvoucher”.</t>

<t>The pledge-voucher-request Content-Type used in the
pledge-responder-mode is defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher"/> as:</t>

<t>application/voucher-jws+json (see <xref target="pvr"/> for the
content definition).</t>

<t>The registrar-agent SHOULD include the “Accept” header field indicating the 
pledge acceptable Content-Type for the voucher-response. The voucher-response
Content-Type “application/voucher-jws+json” is defined in
<xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher"/>.</t>

<t>Upon reception of the pledge-voucher-request, the registrar SHALL
perform the verification of the voucher-request parameter as defined
in section 5.3 of <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
In addition, the registrar shall verify the following parameters from
the pledge-voucher-request:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>agent-provided-proximity-registrar-cert: MUST contain the
own LDevID(Reg) EE certificate to ensure the registrar in
proximity is the target registrar for the request.</t>
  <t>agent-signed-data: The registrar MUST verify that the data
has been signed with the LDevID(RegAgt) credential indicated
in the “kid” JOSE header parameter. If the certificate is
not contained in the agent-sign-cert component of the
pledge-voucher-request, it must fetch the certificate from
a repository.</t>
  <t>agent-sign-cert: May contain the base64-encoded LDevID(RegAgt)
certificate. If contained the registrar MUST verify that the
connected credential used to sign the data was valid at
signature creation time and that the corresponding
registrar-agent was authorized to be involved in the
bootstrapping.</t>
</list></t>

<t>If validation fails the registrar SHOULD respond with the HTTP 404
error code to the registrar-agent. If the pledge-voucher-request is in an
unknown format, then an HTTP 406 error code is more appropriate.</t>

<t>If validation succeeds, the registrar will accept the pledge request
to join the domain as defined in section 5.3 of <xref target="RFC8995"/>. The registrar
then establishes a TLS connection with the MASA as described in section
5.4 of <xref target="RFC8995"/> to
obtain a voucher for the pledge.</t>

<t>The registrar SHALL construct the body of the registrar-voucher-request
object as defined in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
The encoding SHALL be done as JOSE object as defined in
<xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher"/>.</t>

<t>The header of the registrar-voucher-request SHALL contain the following
parameter as defined in <xref target="RFC7515"/>:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>alg: algorithm used for creating the object signature.</t>
  <t>x5c: contains the base64-encoded registrar LDevID certificate.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The body of the registrar-voucher-request object MUST contain the
following parameter as part of the ietf-voucher-request:voucher as
defined in <xref target="RFC8995"/>:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>created-on: contains the current date and time in
yang:date-and-time format for the registrar-voucher-request
creation time.</t>
  <t>nonce: copied form the pledge-voucher-request</t>
  <t>serial-number: contains the base64-encoded product-serial-number.
The registrar MUST verify that the product-serial-number
contained in the IDevID certificate of the pledge matches
the serial-number field in the pledge-voucher-request.
In addition, it MUST be equal to the serial-number field
contained in the agent-signed data of pledge-voucher-request.</t>
  <t>assertion: contains the voucher assertion requested the pledge
(agent-proximity). The registrar provides this
information to assure successful verification of agent
proximity based on the agent-signed-data.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The ietf-voucher-request:voucher can be optionally enhanced with the
following additional parameter:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>agent-sign-cert: Contain the base64-encoded LDevID(RegAgt)
EE certificate if MASA verification of agent-proximity is
required to provide the assertion “agent-proximity”.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The object is signed using the registrar LDevID(Reg) credential,
which corresponds to the certificate signaled in the JOSE header.</t>

<t>The registrar-voucher-request Content-Type is defined in
<xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher"/> as:</t>

<t>application/voucher-jws+json</t>

<t>The registrar SHOULD include an “Accept” header field indicating the
acceptable media type for the voucher-response. The media type
“application/voucher-jws+json” is defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher"/>.</t>

<t>Once the MASA receives the registrar-voucher-request it SHALL
perform the verification of the contained components as described in
section 5.5 in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
In addition, the following additional processing SHALL be done for
components contained in the prior-signed-voucher-request:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>agent-provided-proximity-registrar-cert: The MASA MAY verify
that this field contains the LDevID(Reg) certificate. If so,
it MUST be consistent with the certificate used to sign the
registrar-voucher-request.</t>
  <t>agent-signed-data: The MASA MAY verify this field to be able
to provide an assertion “agent-proximity”. If so, the
agent-signed-data MUST contain the product-serial-number of
the pledge contained in the serial-number component of the
prior-signed-voucher and also in serial-number component of
the registrar-voucher-request. The LDevID(RegAgt) used to
generate provide the signature is identified by the “kid”
parameter of the JOSE header (agent-signed-data). If the
assertion “agent-proximity” is requested, the
registrar-voucher-request MUST contain the corresponding
LDevID(RegAgt) EE certificate in the agent-sign-cert, which
can be verified by the MASA as issued by the same domain CA
as the LDevID(Reg) EE certificate. If the agent-sign-cert is
not provided, the MASA MAY provide a lower level assertion
“logged” or “verified”</t>
</list></t>

<t>If validation fails, the MASA SHOULD respond with an HTTP
error code to the registrar. The error codes are kept as defined in
section 5.6 of <xref target="RFC8995"/>. <!-- XXX -->
and comprise the response codes 403, 404, 406, and 415.</t>

<t>The voucher response format is as indicated in the submitted
Accept header fields or based on the MASA’s prior understanding of
proper format for this pledge. Specifically for the
pledge-responder-mode the “application/voucher-jws+json” as defined
in <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-jws-voucher"/> is applied.
The syntactic details of vouchers are described in detail in
<xref target="RFC8366"/>. <xref target="MASA-vr"/> shows an example of the contents of a voucher.</t>

<t>The MASA sends the voucher in the indicated form to the
registrar. After receiving the voucher the registrar may evaluate
the voucher for transparency and logging purposes as outlined in
section 5.6 of <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
The registrar forwards the voucher without changes to the
registrar-agent.</t>

<t>After receiving the voucher, the registrar-agent sends the
pledge’s enrollment-request to the registrar. Deviating from BRSKI
the enrollment-request is not a raw PKCS#10 request. As the
registrar-agent is involved in the exchange, the PKCS#10 is contained
in the JOSE object. The signature is created using the pledge’s
IDevID to provide proof-of-identity as outlined in <xref target="per"/>.</t>

<t>When using EST, the registrar-agent sends the enrollment request
to the registrar with an HTTPS POST at the endpoint
“/.well-known/est/simpleenroll”.</t>

<t>The enrollment-request Content-Type is:</t>

<t>application/jose</t>

<t>If validation of the wrapping signature fails, the registrar SHOULD
respond with the HTTP 404 error code.  If the voucher-request is
in an unknown format, then an HTTP 406 error code is more appropriate.
A situation that could be resolved with administrative action (such
as adding a vendor/manufacturer IDevID CA as trusted party) MAY be
responded with an 403 HTTP error code.</t>

<t>This results in a deviation from the content types used in <xref target="RFC7030"/>
and results in additional processing at
the domain registrar as EST server as following. Note that the
registrar is already aware that the bootstrapping is performed in
a pledge-responder-mode due to the use of the LDevID(RegAgt)
certificate in the TLS establishment and the provided
pledge-voucher-request in JOSE object.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent MUST provide the collected pledge voucher-status
to the registrar. This status indicates the pledge could process the
voucher successfully or not.</t>

<t>If the TLS connection to the registrar was closed, the registrar-agent
establishes a TLS connection with the registrar as stated in
<xref target="exchanges_uc2_2"/>.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent sends the pledge voucher-status object
without modification to the registrar with an HTTPS POST using the
operation path value of “/.well-known/brski/voucher_status”. The
Content-Type header is kept as “application/jose” as described in
<xref target="exchangesfig_uc2_3"/> and depicted in the example in <xref target="vstat"/>.</t>

<t>The registrar SHALL verify the signature of the pledge voucher-status
and validate that it belongs to an accepted device in his domain
based on the contained “serial-number” in the IDevID certificate
referenced in the header of the voucher-status object.</t>

<t>According to <xref target="RFC8995"/> section 5.7, the registrar SHOULD respond
with an HTTP 200 but MAY
simply fail with an HTTP 404 error.  The registrar-agent may use the
response to signal success / failure to the service technician
operating the registrar agent. Within the server logs the server
SHOULD capture this telemetry information.</t>

<t>The registrar SHOULD proceed with the collecting and logging the
status information by requesting the MASA audit-log from the MASA
service as described in section 5.8 of <xref target="RFC8995"/>.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent MUST provide the enroll-status object to the
registrar. The status indicates the pledge could process the
enroll-response object and holds the corresponding private key.</t>

<t>The registrar-agent sends the pledge enroll-status object
without modification to the registrar with an HTTPS POST using the
operation path value of “/.well-known/brski/enrollstatus”. The
Content-Type header is kept as “application/jose” as described in
<xref target="exchangesfig_uc2_3"/> and depicted in the example in <xref target="estat"/>.</t>

<t>The registrar SHALL verify the signature of the pledge enroll-status
object and validate that it belongs to an accepted device in his domain
based on the contained product-serial-number in the LDevID EE certificate
referenced in the header of the enroll-status object. Note that
the verification of a signature of the object is a deviation form
the described handling in section 5.9.4 of <xref target="RFC8995"/>.</t>

<t>According to <xref target="RFC8995"/> section 5.9.4, the registrar SHOULD respond

<section anchor="exist_prot" title="Example for signature-wrapping using existing enrollment protocols">

<t>This section map the requirements to support proof of possession and
proof of identity to selected existing enrollment protocols.
Note that that the work in the ACE WG described in
<xref target="I-D.selander-ace-coap-est-oscore"/> may be considered
here as well, as it also addresses the encapsulation of EST in a way to
make it independent from the underlying TLS using OSCORE resulting in
an authenticated self-contained object.</t>

<section anchor="est-handling" title="EST Handling">

<t>When using EST <xref target="RFC7030"/>, the following constraints
should be considered:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Proof of possession is provided by using the specified PKCS#10
structure in the request.</t>
  <t>Proof of identity is achieved by signing the certification
request object, which is only supported when Full PKI Request
(the /fullcmc endpoint) is used. This contains sufficient
information for the RA to make an authorization decision on the
received certification request.
Note: EST references CMC <xref target="RFC5272"/> for the
definition of the Full PKI Request. For proof of identity, the
signature of the SignedData of the Full PKI Request would be
calculated using the IDevID credential of the pledge.</t>
  <t>[RFC Editor: please delete] /* TBD: in this case the binding to
the underlying TLS connection is not be necessary. */</t>
  <t>When the RA is not available, as per <xref target="RFC7030"/> Section 4.2.3, a
202 return code should be returned by the
Registrar. The pledge in this case would retry a simpleenroll
with a PKCS#10 request. Note that if the TLS connection is teared
down for the waiting time, the PKCS#10 request would need to be
rebuilt if it contains the unique identifier (tls_unique) from
the underlying TLS connection for the binding.</t>

fullcmc is necessary as not specified in the context of EST */</t>

<abstract><t>As networked devices become smaller, more portable, and more ubiquitous, the ability to operate with less configured infrastructure is increasingly important.

   JSON document that has been signed using a Cryptographic Message
   Syntax (CMS) structure.  This memo introduces a variant of the
   voucher structure in which CMS is replaced by the JSON Object Signing
   and Encryption (JOSE) mechanism described in RFC7515 to better
   support use-cases in which JOSE is preferred over CMS.

   In addition to explaining how the format is created, MIME types are
   registered and examples are provided.

	 <t>   This document aims at simple, interoperable, and automated PKI
   management operations covering typical use cases of industrial and
   IoT scenarios.  This is achieved by profiling the Certificate
   Management Protocol (CMP), the related Certificate Request Message
   Format (CRMF), and HTTP-based or CoAP-based transport in a succinct
   but sufficiently detailed and self-contained way.  To make secure
   certificate management for simple scenarios and constrained devices
   as lightweight as possible, only the most crucial types of operations
   and options are specified as mandatory.  More special and complex use
   cases are supported as well, by features specified as recommended or

      <abstract>
	 <t>   This document contains a set of updates to the syntax and transport
   of Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) version 2.  This document
   updates RFC 4210 and RFC 6712.

   The aspects of CMP updated in this document are using EnvelopedData
   instead of EncryptedValue, clarifying the handling of p10cr messages,
   improving the crypto agility, as well as adding new general message
   types, extended key usages to identify certificates for use with CMP,
   and &#39;.well-known&#39; HTTP path segments.

   To properly differentiate the support of EnvelopedData instead of
   EncryptedValue, the CMP version 3 is introduced in case a transaction
   is supposed to use EnvelopedData.

   CMP version 3 is introduced to enable signaling support of
   EnvelopedData instead of EncryptedValue and signaling the use of an
   explicit hash AlgorithmIdentifier in certConf messages, as far as
   needed.

for use case 2.</t>
  <t>Rework of use case 2 in <xref target="uc2"/> to consider the
transport between the pledge and the pledge-agent. Addressed is
the TLS channel establishment between the pledge-agent and the

  <t>First description of exchanged object types (needs more work)</t>
  <t>Clarification in discovery options for enrollment endpoints at
the domain registrar based on well-known endpoints in
<xref target="discovery_eo"/> do not result in additional
/.well-known URIs. Update of the illustrative example.
Note that the change to /brski for the voucher related endpoints

  <t>Updated references.</t>
  <t>Included Thomas Werner as additional author for the document.</t>
</list></t>

<t>From individual version 03 -&gt; IETF draft 00:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Inclusion of discovery options of enrollment endpoints at
the domain registrar based on well-known endpoints in
<xref target="discovery_eo"/> as replacement of section 5.1.3
in the individual draft. This is intended to support both use
cases in the document. An illustrative example is provided.</t>

  <t>Removal of copied call flows for voucher exchange and registrar
discovery flow from <xref target="RFC8995"/> in <xref target="uc1"/> to avoid doubling or text or
inconsistencies.</t>
  <t>Reworked abstract and introduction to be more crisp regarding
the targeted solution. Several structural changes in the document
to have a better distinction between requirements, use case
description, and solution description as separate sections.
History moved to appendix.</t>
</list></t>

<t>From individual version 02 -&gt; 03:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Update of terminology from self-contained to authenticated
self-contained object to be consistent in the wording and to
underline the protection of the object with an existing
credential. Note that the naming of this object may be discussed.
An alternative name may be attestation object.</t>
  <t>Simplification of the architecture approach for the initial use
case having an offsite PKI.</t>
  <t>Introduction of a new use case utilizing authenticated
self-contain objects to onboard a pledge using a commissioning
tool containing a pledge-agent. This requires additional changes
in the BRSKI call flow sequence and led to changes in the
introduction, the application example,and also in the
related BRSKI-AE call flow.</t>
  <t>Update of provided examples of the addressing approach used in
BRSKI to allow for support of multiple enrollment protocols in
<xref target="addressing"/>.</t>

  <t>Update of introduction text to clearly relate to the usage of
IDevID and LDevID.</t>
  <t>Definition of the addressing approach used in BRSKI to allow for
support of multiple enrollment protocols in <xref target="addressing"/>.  This
section also contains a first
discussion of an optional discovery mechanism to address
situations in which the registrar supports more than one enrollment
approach. Discovery should avoid that the pledge performs a trial
and error of enrollment protocols.</t>
  <t>Update of description of architecture elements and
changes to BRSKI in <xref target="architecture"/>.</t>
  <t>Enhanced consideration of existing enrollment protocols in the
context of mapping the requirements to existing solutions in

  <t>Update of examples, specifically for building automation as
well as two new application use cases in <xref target="app-examples"/>.</t>
  <t>Deletion of asynchronous interaction with MASA to not
complicate the use case. Note that the voucher exchange can
already be handled in an asynchronous manner and is therefore
not considered further. This resulted in removal of the
alternative path the MASA in Figure 1 and the associated
description in <xref target="architecture"/>.</t>
  <t>Enhancement of description of architecture elements and
changes to BRSKI in <xref target="architecture"/>.</t>
  <t>Consideration of existing enrollment protocols in the context
