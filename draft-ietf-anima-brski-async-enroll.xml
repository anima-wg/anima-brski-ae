<t>This document describes enhancements of
Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI, <xref target="RFC8995"/>) to support
end-to-end security and asynchronous operation of certficiate enrollment.
By making BRSKI flexible on the certificate enrollment protocol being used,
BRSKI-AE allows employing protocols such as CMP, where the origin of certificate
requests and responses can be authenticated independently of message transfer.
Using self-contained (signature-wrapped) objects
for requesting and returning domain-specific device certificates,
the origin and authenticity of messages can be verified
also in environments that have no (or just limited) online connectivity.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>BRSKI, as defined in <xref target="RFC8995"/>, specifies a solution for
secure automated zero-touch bootstrapping of devices (aka pledges)
in an operational domain. This includes the discovery of network elements
in the target domain, time synchronization, and the exchange of security
information necessary to establish trust between a pledge and the domain.</t>

<t>Security information about the target domain, specifically the
target domain certificate to be trusted by new devices,
is exchanged utilizing voucher objects defined in <xref target="RFC8366"/>.
These vouchers are self-contained signed objects
originating from a Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority (MASA).
They may be provided online (synchronously) or offline (asynchronously)
via the domain registrar to the pledge.
A plede can authenticate the voucher because it is shipped with a trust anchor
of its manufacturer such that it can validate signatures by the MASA.</t>

<t>Trust by the domain in a new pledge is established by enrolling a first
end-entity (EE) certificate of the pledge that is specific to the target domain.
For enrolling devices with these so-called LDevID certificates,
BRSKI typically relies on Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) <xref target="RFC7030"/>.
While using EST has the advantage that the mutually authenticated TLS connection
established between the pledge and the registrar can be reused
for protecting also the message exchange for enrolling the LDevID certificate,
it has the limitation that this cannot not provide end-to-end security for the
certificate enrollment because the TLS session terminates at the registrar.
Moreover, properly binding the proof of origin of a certification request to
the proof of posession for the new private key via the so-called tls-unique is
conceptually non-trivial and requires specific support by the TLS implementation.
For these and other reasons (such as, more freedom w.r.t. proof-of-possession
methods), it may be preferable to use an alternative enrollment protocol,
such as CMP or CMC, that is more flexible and independent of the transfer level
because it represents certification requests as authenticated self-contained
objects.</t>

<t>When using EST, the pledge the client interacting via TLS with the domain
registrar, which acts both as EST server and as registration authority (RA).
The TLS connection is mutually authenticated, where the pledge uses an
initial device certificate (aka IDevID certificate) issued by its manufacturer.
In order to provide proof of origin of the certificate request,
i.e., proof of identity of the requester, EST specifically relies on binding
the certification request to the underlying TLS channel via the 'tls-unique'
<xref target="RFC5929"/>.
The EST server (the domain registrar) terminates the security
association with the pledge and thus the binding between the
certification request and the authentication of the pledge via TLS.
The EST server uses the authenticated pledge identity provided by the IDevID
for checking the authorization of the pledge for the given certification request
before issuing to the pledge a domain-specific certificate (LDevID certificate).
This approach typically requires online or on-site availability of
an asset management system (e.g., a device inventory)
for performing the final authorization decision for the certification request.
This type of enrollment utilizing an online connection to the PKI
can be called <em>synchronous enrollment</em>.</t>

<t>The required RA/CA components and/or asset management system may not be
part of the registrar. They even may not be available on-site but rather be
provided by remote backend systems. The registrar or its site may have no online
connection with them or the connectivity may be intermittent.
This may be due to security requirements for operating the backend systems
or due to site deployments where on-site or always-online operation
may be not feasible or too costly.
In such cases the authorization of certification request based on an asset
management system will not or can not be performed on-site at enrollment time.
In this document, enrollment that is not performed in a (time-wise) consistent
way is called <em>asynchronous enrollment</em>.
Asynchronous enrollment requires a store-and-forward transfer of certification
requests along with the information needed for authenticating the requester.
This enables off-line processing the request at a later point in time.</t>

<t>A similar situation may occur through network segmentation, which is
utilized in industrial systems to separate domains with different
security needs. Here, a similar requirement arises if the communication
channel carrying the requester authentication is terminated before
the registrar/RA can authorize the certification request.
When a second communication channel is used to forward the certification
request to the RA and issuing CA, the requester authentication information
needs to be retained and ideally bound directly to the certification request.
This use case is independent of the time-wise limitations of the first use case.</t>

<t>There are basically two options for forwarding certification requests
along with requester authentication information:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Having a trusted component (e.g., a local RA) in the target
domain that stores the certification request combined with
the requester authentication information (based on the IDevID)
and potentially the information about successful verification of
the proof of possession (of the corresponding private key) in a way
preventing changes to the combined information.
Note that the information elements may not have been bound cryptographically.
When connectivity to backend PKI components is available, the trusted
component forwards the certification request together with
the requester information (authentication and proof of
possession) for further processing.
This case offers only hop-by-hop security: the backend PKI must rely on the
local pledge authentication result when performing the
authorization and issuing the requested certificate.
In BRSKI the trusted component may be the EST server,
co-located with the registrar in the target domain.</t>
  <t>Utilizing authenticated self-contained objects for the
enrollment, directly binding the certification request and the
requester authentication in a cryptographic way. This approach supports
end-to-end security, reducing the need to trust in an intermediate domain
component. Unauthorized modification of the requester
information (request and authentication) can be detected during
the verification of the authenticated self-contained object.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Focus of this document is the support of alternative enrollment protocols
that allow handling authenticated self-contained
objects for device certificate bootstrapping. This enhancement of BRSKI
is named BRSKI-AE, where AE stands for both alternative enrollment protocols
and asynchronous enrollment.
Like BRSKI, BRSKI-AE results in the pledge storing an X.509 domain
certificate and sufficient information for verifying the domain
registrar identity (LDevID CA certificate) as well as
domain-specific X.509 device certificates (LDevID EE certificates).</t>

<t>The goals are to enhance BRSKI to
* support alternative enrollment protocols,
* support end-to-end security for enrollment, and
* make it applicable to use cases involving asynchrionous enrollment.</t>

<t>This is achieved by</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>extending the well-known URI approach with an additional path element
indicating the enrollment protocol being used, and</t>
  <t>defining a certificate waiting indication and handling, for the case that the
certifying component is (temporarily) not available.</t>
</list></t>

<t>BRSKI-AE can be applied to both synchronous and asynchronous enrollment.</t>

<t>In contrast to BRSKI, BRSKI-AE supports offering multiple enrollment protocols
on the infrastructure side, which enables pledges and their developers
to pick one of these.</t>

<section anchor="scope-of-solution"><name>Scope of solution</name>

<section anchor="sup-env"><name>Supported environment</name>

<t>This solution is intended to be used in domains that may have limited support
of on-site PKI services and comprises use cases like the following.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>There are requirements or implementation restrictions
that do not allow the use of EST for enrolling LDevID certificates.</t>
  <t>Pledges and/or the target deployment domain already have an established

(e.g., in brownfield installations).</t>
  <t>There is no registration authority available in the target domain.
Connectivity to an off-site RA is intermittent or entirely offline.
A store-and-forward mechanism is used
for communicating with the off-site services.</t>
  <t>Authoritative actions of a local RA are limited and may not be sufficient
for authorizing certification requests by pledges.
Final authorization is done by an RA residing in the operator domain.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="app-examples"><name>Application Examples</name>

<t>The following examples are intended to motivate the support of
different enrollment protocol approaches in general and asynchronous enrollment
specifically. They introduce industrial application scenarios
where leveraging BRSKI as-is would be problematic because they need support of
asynchronous operation or protocols other than EST, as supported by BRSKI-AE.</t>

<section anchor="rolling-stock"><name>Rolling stock</name>

<t>Rolling stock or railroad cars contain a variety of sensors,
actuators, and controllers, which communicate within the railroad car
but also exchange information between railroad cars building a train,
with track-side equipment, and/or possibly with backend systems.
These devices are typically unaware of backend system
connectivity. Managing certificates may be done during maintenance
cycles of the railroad car, but can already be prepared during
operation. Preparation will include generating certification requests,
which are collected and later forwarded for
processing, once the railroad car is connected to the operator backend.
The authorization of the certification request is then done based on
the operator's asset/inventory information in the backend.</t>

<t>UNISIG has included a CMP profile for enrollment of TLS certificates of
on-board and track-side components in the Subset-137 specifying the ETRAM/ETCS
on-line key management for train control systems <xref target="UNISIG-Subset-137"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="building-automation"><name>Building automation</name>

<t>In the building automation scenarios, a detached
building or the basement of a building may be equipped with sensors, actuators,
and controllers that are connected with each other in a local network but
with only limited or no connectivity to a central building management system.
This problem may occur during installation time but also during operation.
In such a situation a service technician collects the necessary data
and transfers it between the local network and the central building management
system, e.g., using a laptop or a mobile phone.
This data may comprise parameters and settings
required in the operational phase of the sensors/actuators, like a
component certificate issued by the operator to authenticate against other
components and services.</t>

<t>The collected data may be provided by a domain registrar
already existing in the local network. In this case
connectivity to the backend PKI may be facilitated by the service
technician's laptop.
Alternatively, the data can also be collected from the
pledges directly and provided to a domain registrar deployed in a
different network. In this case, connectivity to the domain registrar
may also be facilitated by the service technician's laptop.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="substation-automation"><name>Substation automation</name>

<t>In electrical substation automation scenarios ,a control center typically hosts
PKI services to issue certificates for Intelligent Electronic Devices
(IEDs) operated in a substation. Communication between the substation
and control center is performed through a proxy/gateway/DMZ, which
terminates protocol flows. Note that <xref target="NERC-CIP-005-5"/> requires
inspection of protocols at the boundary of a security
perimeter (the substation in this case).
In addition, security management in substation automation assumes
central support of several enrollment protocols in order to support the
various capabilities of IEDs from different vendors. The IEC standard
IEC62351-9 <xref target="IEC-62351-9"/> specifies mandatory
support of two enrollment protocols: SCEP <xref target="RFC8894"/> and EST
<xref target="RFC7030"/> for the infrastructure side, while
the IED must only support one of the two.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure"><name>Electric vehicle charging infrastructure</name>

<t>For electric vehicle charging infrastructure, protocols have been
defined for the interaction between the electric vehicle and the
charging point (e.g., ISO 15118-2 <xref target="ISO-IEC-15118-2"/>)
as well as between the charging point and the charging point operator
(e.g. OCPP <xref target="OCPP"/>). Depending on the authentication
model, unilateral or mutual authentication is required. In both cases
the charging point uses an X.509 certificate to authenticate itself
for TLS connections between the electric vehicle and
the charging point. The management of this certificate depends,
among others, on the selected backend connectivity protocol.
In the case of OCPP, this protocol is meant to be the only communication
protocol between the charging point and the backend, carrying all
information to control the charging operations and maintain the
charging point itself. This means that the certificate management
needs to be handled in-band of OCPP. This requires the ability to
encapsulate the certificate management messages in a transport-independent way.
Authenticated self-containment will support this by
allowing the transport without a separate enrollment protocol,
binding the messages to the identity of the communicating endpoints.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="infrastructure-isolation-policy"><name>Infrastructure isolation policy</name>

<t>This refers to any case in which network infrastructure is normally
isolated from the Internet as a matter of policy, most likely for
security reasons. In such a case, limited access to external PKI
resources will be allowed in carefully controlled short periods of
time, for example when a batch of new devices is deployed, and
forbidden or prevented at other times.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="less-operational-security-in-the-target-domain"><name>Less operational security in the target domain</name>

<t>The registration authority performing (at least part of) the authorization of a
certification request is a critical PKI component and therefore requires higher
operational security than components utilizing the issued
certificates for their security features. CAs may also demand higher
security in the registration procedures. Especially the CA/Browser
forum currently increases the security requirements in the certificate
issuance procedures for publicly trusted certificates.
There may be situations where the target domain does not offer a sufficient
level of security to operate a registration authority and therefore wants to
transfer this service to a backend service that offers a higher security level.</t>

</section>
</section>
</section>
<section anchor="req-sol"><name>Requirements discussion and mapping to solution elements</name>

<t>For the requirements discussion we assume that the domain
registrar receiving a certification request as an authenticated
object is not the (final) authorization point for this
certification request. If the domain registrar is the only authorization
point and the pledge has a direct connection to it, BRSKI can be used directly.
Note that BRSKI-AE may still be needed
in this case, for instance when the pledge prefers a protocol other than EST.</t>

<t>Based on the intended target environment described in <xref target="sup-env"/> and
the application examples described in <xref target="app-examples"/>, the following
requirements are derived to support authenticated self-contained
objects as container carrying certification requests and further
information to support asynchronous operation.</t>

<t>At least the following properties are required:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Proof of possession: demonstrates access to the private
key corresponding to the public key contained in a certification request.
This is typically achieved by a self-signature using the private key.</t>
  <t>Proof of identity: provides data origin authentication of a data object
such as a certificate request. This typically is achieved by a signature
using the private key associated with the IDevID certificate of the pledge,
or, in case of certificate updates, with the certificate to be updated.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Here is an incomplete list of solution examples,
based on existing technology described in IETF documents:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Certification request objects: Certification requests are
data structures protecting only the integrity of the contained data
and providing proof of possession for a (locally generated) private key.
Examples for certification request data structures are:  <list style="symbols">
      <t>PKCS#10 <xref target="RFC2986"/>. The structure is self-signed to
protect its integrity and prove possession of the private key
that corresponds to the included public key of the requester.</t>
      <t>CRMF <xref target="RFC4211"/>. Also this structure supports
integrity protection and proof of possession,
typically by a self-signature generated over (part of) the structure
with the private key corresponding to the included public key.
CRMF also supports further proof-of-possession methods
for types of keys that do not support any signature algorithm.</t>
    </list>
The integrity protection of certification request fields includes the public
key because it is part of the data signed by the corresponding private key.
Yet note that for the above examples this is not sufficient to provide data
origin authentication, i.e., proof of identity. This extra property can be
achieved by an additional binding to the IDevID of the pledge.
This binding to source authentication supports the
authorization decision for the certification request. The binding of data
origin authentication to the certification request may be
delegated to the protocol used for certificate management.</t>
  <t>Solution options for proof of identity: The certification request should be
bound to an existing authenticated credential (here, IDevID) to enable a proof
of identity and, based on it, an authorization of the certification request.
The binding may be achieved through security options in an
underlying transport protocol such as TLS if the authorization of the
certification request is (completely) done at the next communication hop.
This binding can also be done in a transport-independent way by wrapping the
certification request with signature employing an existing credential. In
the BRSKI context, this will be the IDevID initially, the LDevID for renewals.
This requirement is addressed by existing enrollment protocols
in various ways, such as:  <list style="symbols">
      <t>EST <xref target="RFC7030"/> utilizes PKCS#10 to
encode the certification request. The Certificate Signing
Request (CSR) may contain a binding to the underlying TLS session
by including the tls-unique value in the self-signed CSR structure.
The tls-unique value results from the TLS handshake.
Since the TLS handshake includes client
authentication and the pledge utilizes its IDevID for it,
the proof of identity can be provided by the binding to
the TLS session. This is supported in EST using the
/simpleenroll endpoint. As an alternative to binding to the underlying
authentication in the transport layer, <xref target="RFC7030"/> sketches wrapping the CSR
with a Full PKI Request message using an existing certificate.</t>
      <t>SCEP <xref target="RFC8894"/> supports using a shared secret (passphrase) or
an existing certificate to protect CSRs based on
SCEP Secure Message Objects using CMS wrapping
(<xref target="RFC5652"/>). Note that the wrapping using
an existing IDevID credential in SCEP is referred to as renewal.
Thus SCEP does not rely on the security of the underlying transfer.</t>
      <t>CMP <xref target="RFC4210"/> supports using a shared secret (passphrase) or an existing
certificate, which may be an IDevID credential, to authenticate
certification requests via the PKIProtection structure in a PKIMessage.
The certification request is typically encoded utilizing CRMF,
while PKCS#10 is supported as an alternative.
Thus CMP does not rely on the security of the underlying transfer.</t>
      <t>CMC <xref target="RFC5272"/> also supports utilizing a shared secret (passphrase) or
an existing certificate to protect certification requests,
which can be either in CRMF or PKCS#10 format.
The proof of identity can be provided as part of a FullCMCRequest,
based on CMS <xref target="RFC5652"/> and signed with an existing IDevID credential.
Thus CMC does not rely on the security of the underlying transfer.</t>
    </list></t>
</list></t>

<t>Note that, besides the existing enrollment protocols, there is
ongoing work in the ACE WG to define an encapsulation of EST messages in
OSCORE, which will result in a TLS-independent way of protecting EST.
This approach <xref target="I-D.selander-ace-coap-est-oscore"/>
may be considered as a further variant.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="architecture"><name>Architectural Overview and Message Exchange</name>

<t>In order to support alternative enrollment protocols, asynchronous enrollment,
and more general system architectures,
BRSKI-AE lifts some restrictions of BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
This way, authenticated self-contained objects such as those described in
<xref target="req-sol"/> above can be used for certificate enrollment.</t>

<t>The enhancements needed are kept to a minimum in order to ensure reuse of
already defined architecture elements and interactions.
In general, the communication follows the BRSKI model and utilizes the existing
BRSKI architecture elements.
In particular, the pledge initiates communication with the domain registrar
and interacts with the MASA as usual.</t>

<section anchor="uc1"><name>Support of off-site PKI service</name>

<t>The key element of BRSKI-AE is that the authorization of a
certification request <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be performed based on an authenticated
self-contained object, binding the certification request to the
authentication using the IDevID. This enables interaction with
off-site or off-line PKI (RA/CA) components.
In addition, the authorization of the certification request <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be done not only
by the domain registrar but by PKI components residing in the backend
of the domain operator (off-site) as described in <xref target="sup-env"/>.
Also, the certification request <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be piggybacked on another protocol.
This leads to generalizations in the
placement and enhancements of the logical elements as shown in <xref target="uc1figure"/>.</t>

         off-site or central "domain" components
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The architecture overview in <xref target="uc1figure"/> has
the same logical elements as BRSKI, but with more flexible placement.
The PKI component that performs the authorization decision for certification
request messages <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be off-site or in the central domain of the operator,
to which the deployment or on-site domain of the pledge
may have no or only temporary (intermittent) connectivity.
This is to underline the option that the authorization decision for the
certification request may also be performed in the backend.</t>

<t>The following list describes the components in the deployment target domain
of the pledge.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Join Proxy: same functionality as described in BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/>.</t>
  <t>Domain Registrar / Enrollment Proxy: in BRSKI-AE,
the domain registrar has mostly the same functionality as in BRSKI, namely
to facilitate the communication of the pledge with the MASA and the PKI.
Regarding the enrollment of the pledge to the deployment domain,
there is a difference in the authorization of certification requests.
BRSKI-AE allows to perform this in the operator's backend (off-site),
and not just directly at the domain registrar.</t>
  <t>Voucher exchange: the voucher exchange with the MASA  via
the domain registrar is performed as described in BRSKI.</t>
  <t>Certificate enrollment:
the domain registrar in the deployment domain supports the
  adoption of the pledge in the domain based on the voucher
  request. Nevertheless, it may not have sufficient
  information for authorizing the certification request.
If the authorization is done off-site, the domain registrar <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> forward
the certification request to the RA to perform the authorization there.
In this case  the certification request object <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include
a proof of origin such that the authorization to be based on the
included pledge identity information.
As stated above, this <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be done by an additional signature
using the IDevID.
  The domain registrar here <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> act as an enrollment proxy or
  local registration authority. It is also able to handle the
situation that it has only intermittent connection to an off-site PKI
  by storing the authenticated certification request and
  forwarding it to the RA upon reestablished connectivity.
  As authenticated self-contained objects are used, it
  requires an enhancement of the domain registrar. This is
  done by supporting alternative enrollment approaches
  (protocol options, protocols, encoding) and generalizing the
  addressing scheme to communicate with the domain registrar
  (see <xref target="addressing"/>).</t>
</list></t>

<t>The following list describes the vendor-related components/service
outside the deployment domain.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>MASA: general functionality as described in BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/>.
Note that the interaction with the MASA may be
synchronous (voucher request with nonce) or asynchronous
(voucher request without nonce).</t>
  <t>Ownership tracker: as defined in BRSKI.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The following list describes the operator-related components/service
operated in the off-site backend of the domain.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>PKI RA: Performs certificate management functions (validation
of requests, where final authorization of certification requests
may be done by interaction with an asset management system, etc.)
for issuing, updating, and revoking certificates for a domain
as a centralized infrastructure for the domain operator.
The asset management system may be integrated with the RA directly
or may be a separate component that is possibly located off-site.</t>
  <t>PKI CA: Performs certificate generation by signing the certificate structure
provided in already authenticated and authorized certification requests.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Based on BRSKI and the architectural changes, the original protocol
flow is divided into three phases showing commonalities and
differences to the original approach as follows.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Discovery phase: same as in BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/> steps (1) and (2)</t>
  <t>Voucher exchange with deployment domain registrar:
same as in BRSKI steps (3) and (4).</t>
  <t>Enrollment phase: step (5) is changed to support the application of
authenticated self-contained objects.</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="behavior-of-a-pledge"><name>Behavior of a pledge</name>

<t>The behavior of a pledge as described in <xref target="RFC8995"/> is kept with one exception.
After finishing the imprinting phase (4)
the enrollment phase (5) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be performed with a method supporting
authenticated self-contained objects. Note that EST with simple-enroll
cannot be applied here, as it binds the pledge authentication with
the existing IDevID to the transport channel (TLS) rather than to
the certification request object directly. This authentication in
the transport layer is not visible / verifiable at the authorization
point in the off-site domain. <xref target="exist_prot"/> discusses
suitable enrollment protocols and options applicable.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="discovery"><name>Pledge - Registrar discovery and voucher exchange</name>

<t>The discovery phase is applied as specified in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="vexchange"><name>Registrar - MASA voucher exchange</name>

<t>The voucher exchange is performed as specified in <xref target="RFC8995"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="enroll"><name>Pledge - Registrar - RA/CA certificate enrollment</name>

<t>As stated in <xref target="req-sol"/>, the enrollment <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
performed using an authenticated self-contained object providing
not only proof of possession but also proof of identity (source authentication).</t>

<t>The following list provides an abstract description of the flow
depicted in <xref target="enrollfigure"/>.</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>CA Cert Request: The pledge <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> request the latest relevant
CA Certificates. This ensures that the pledge has the
complete set of current CA certificates beyond the
pinned-domain-cert (which may be the domain registrar certificate
contained in the voucher).</t>
  <t>CA Cert Response: <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> contain at least the CA certificate of
the issuing CA.</t>
  <t>Attribute Request: Typically, the automated bootstrapping occurs
without local administrative configuration of the pledge.
Nevertheless, there are cases in which the pledge may also
include additional attributes specific to the deployment domain
into the certification request. To get these attributes in
advance, the attribute request <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be used.</t>
  <t>Attribute Response: <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> contain the attributes to be included
in the subsequent certification request.</t>
  <t>Cert Request: This certification request <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain the authenticated
self-contained object ensuring both proof of possession of the
corresponding private key and proof of identity of the requester.</t>
  <t>Cert Response: The certification response message <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain on success the
requested certificate and <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> include potentially further information, like
certificates of intermediary CAs on the certification path.</t>
  <t>Cert Waiting: Optional waiting indication for the pledge, which <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> retry
after a given time. For this a request identifier is necessary.
This request identifier may be either part of the enrollment
protocol or can derived from the certification request.</t>
  <t>Cert Polling: This is <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be used by the pledge to query the registrar
whether the certification request meanwhile has been processed;
can be answered either by another Cert Waiting, or a Cert Response.</t>
  <t>Cert Confirm: positive or negative confirmation message by the pledge
the <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be sent after receiving and verifying a new certificate.</t>
  <t>PKI/Registrar Confirm: An acknowledgment by the PKI or domain registrar
that <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be sent on reception of the Cert Confirm.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The generic messages described above <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be implemented using various
enrollment protocols supporting authenticated self-contained request objects,
as described in <xref target="req-sol"/>. Examples are available in <xref target="exist_prot"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="addressing"><name>Addressing Scheme Enhancements</name>

<t>BRSKI-AE provides generalizations to the addressing scheme defined in
BRSKI <xref target="RFC8995"/> to accommodate alternative enrollment protocols that
use authenticated self-contained objects for certification requests.
As this is supported by various existing enrollment protocols,
they can be directly employed (see also <xref target="exist_prot"/>).</t>

<t>The addressing scheme in BRSKI for client certificate request and
CA certificate distribution function during the enrollment uses
the definition from EST <xref target="RFC7030"/>, here on the
example on simple enrollment: "/.well-known/est/simpleenroll"
This approach is generalized to the following notation:
"/.well-known/&lt;enrollment-protocol&gt;/&lt;request&gt;"
in which &lt;enrollment-protocol&gt; can be an already existing protocol or
a newly defined approach. Note that enrollment is considered here
as a sequence of at least a certification request and a certification
response. In case of existing enrollment protocols the following
notation is used proving compatibility to BRSKI:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>&lt;enrollment-protocol&gt;: <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> reference the protocol being used,
which <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be EST <xref target="RFC7030"/> as in BRSKI
or CMP, CMC, SCEP, or a newly defined approach.
Note: additional endpoints (well-known URIs) at the registrar
may need to be defined by the utilized enrollment protocol.</t>
  <t>&lt;request&gt;: depending on the utilized enrollment protocol,
the &lt;request&gt; path component <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> describe the required operation at the
registrar side. Enrollment protocols are expected to
define their request endpoints, as done by existing protocols
(see also <xref target="exist_prot"/>).</t>
</list></t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="discovery_eo"><name>Domain registrar support of specific enrollment options</name>

<t>Well-known URIs for various endpoints on the domain registrar are
already defined as part of the base BRSKI specification. In
addition, alternative enrollment endpoints <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be supported at the
domain registrar. The pledge will recognize whether its
preferred enrollment option is supported by the domain registrar
by sending a request to its preferred enrollment endpoint
and evaluating the HTTP response status code.</t>

<t>The following figure provides an illustrative example for a domain
registrar supporting several options for EST as well as for
CMP to be used in BRSKI-AE. The listing contains the supported
endpoints to which the pledge may connect for bootstrapping. This
includes the voucher handling as well as the enrollment endpoints.
The CMP related enrollment endpoints are defined as well-known URIs
in CMP Updates <xref target="I-D.ietf-lamps-cmp-updates"/>
and the Lightweight CMP profile <xref target="I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile"/>.</t>

<section anchor="exist_prot"><name>Examples for signature-wrapping using existing enrollment protocols</name>

<t>This section maps the requirements to support proof of possession and
proof of identity to selected existing enrollment protocols.</t>

<t>Note that the work in the ACE WG described in
<xref target="I-D.selander-ace-coap-est-oscore"/> may be considered
here as well, as it also addresses the encapsulation of EST in a way to
make it independent of the underlying TLS connection using OSCORE,
which also entails that authenticated self-contained objects are used.</t>

<section anchor="est-handling"><name>EST Handling</name>

<t>When using EST <xref target="RFC7030"/>, the following aspects and constraints
need to be considered and the given extra requirements <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be observed:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Proof of possession is provided by using the specified PKCS#10
structure in the request.</t>
  <t>Proof of identity <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be achieved by signing the certification request
object using the Full PKI Request option (including the /fullcmc endpoint).
This provides sufficient
information for the RA to make an authorization decision on the
received certification request.
Note: EST references CMC <xref target="RFC5272"/> for the
definition of the Full PKI Request. For proof of identity, the
signature of the SignedData of the Full PKI Request is
performed using the IDevID credential of the pledge.</t>
  <t>TBD RFC Editor: please delete /* TBD: in this case the binding to
the underlying TLS connection is not necessary. */</t>
  <t>When the RA is temporarily not available, as per <xref target="RFC7030"/> section 4.2.3,
an HTTP status code 202 <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be returned by the
Registrar. The pledge in this case will retry a /simpleenroll
with a PKCS#10 request. Note that if the TLS connection is taken
down during the waiting period, the PKCS#10 request needs to be
rebuilt if it contains the unique identifier (tls_unique) from
the underlying TLS connection for the binding.</t>
  <t>TBD RFC Editor: please delete /* TBD: clarification of retry for
fullcmc is necessary as not specified in the context of EST */</t>

<xref target="I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile"/>, as it
restricts full-featured CMP to the functionality needed here.</t>

<t>When using this variant of CMP, the following requirements <bcp14>SHALL</bcp14> be observed:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>For proof of possession, the approach defined in the Lightweight CMP Profile
<xref target="I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile"/> section 4.1.1 (based on CRMF)

      <abstract>
	 <t>   This document contains a set of updates to the syntax and transfer of
   Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) version 2.  This document
   updates RFC 4210, RFC 5912, and RFC 6712.

   The aspects of CMP updated in this document are using EnvelopedData
   instead of EncryptedValue, clarifying the handling of p10cr messages,
   improving the crypto agility, as well as adding new general message
   types, extended key usages to identify certificates for use with CMP,
   and &#39;.well-known&#39; HTTP path segments.

   To properly differentiate the support of EnvelopedData instead of
   EncryptedValue, the CMP version 3 is introduced in case a transaction
   is supposed to use EnvelopedData.

   CMP version 3 is introduced to enable signaling support of
   EnvelopedData instead of EncryptedValue and signaling the use of an
   explicit hash AlgorithmIdentifier in certConf messages, as far as
   needed.

Bootstrapping a new device can occur when using a routable address and a cloud service, only link-local connectivity, or limited/disconnected networks. Support for deployment models with less stringent security requirements is included. Bootstrapping is complete when the cryptographic identity of the new key infrastructure is successfully deployed to the device.  The established secure connection can be used to deploy a locally issued certificate to the device as well.</t></abstract>

  <t>Streamlined wording and improved grammar throughout the text.</t>
  <t>Shifted the focus more towards the use of alternative enrollment protocols.</t>

<t>From IETF draft 03 -&gt; IETF draft 04:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Moved UC2 related parts defining the pledge in responder mode to a 
separate document. This required changes and adaptations in several 
sections. Main changes concerned the removal of the subsection for UC2 
as well as the removal of the YANG model related text as it is not 
applicable in UC1.</t>
  <t>Updated references to the Lightweight CMP Profile.</t>
  <t>Added David von Oheimb as co-author.</t>
</list></t>

<t>From IETF draft 02 -&gt; IETF draft 03:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Housekeeping, deleted open issue regarding YANG voucher-request
in UC2 as voucher-request was enhanced with additional leaf.</t>
  <t>Included open issues in YANG model in UC2 regarding assertion
value agent-proximity and CSR encapsulation using SZTP sub module).</t>
</list></t>

<t>From IETF draft 01 -&gt; IETF draft 02:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Defined call flow and objects for interactions in UC2. Object format
based on draft for JOSE signed voucher artifacts and aligned the
remaining objects with this approach in UC2 .</t>
  <t>Terminology change: issue #2 pledge-agent -&gt; registrar-agent to
better underline agent relation.</t>
  <t>Terminology change: issue #3 PULL/PUSH -&gt; pledge-initiator-mode
and pledge-responder-mode to better address the pledge operation.</t>
  <t>Communication approach between pledge and registrar-agent
changed by removing TLS-PSK (former section TLS establishment)
and associated references to other drafts in favor of relying on
higher layer exchange of signed data objects. These data objects
are included also in the pledge-voucher-request and lead to an
extension of the YANG module for the voucher-request (issue #12).</t>
  <t>Details on trust relationship between registrar-agent and
registrar (issue #4, #5, #9) included in UC2.</t>
  <t>Recommendation regarding short-lived certificates for
registrar-agent authentication towards registrar (issue #7) in
the security considerations.</t>
  <t>Introduction of reference to agent signing certificate using SKID
in agent signed data (issue #11).</t>
  <t>Enhanced objects in exchanges between pledge and registrar-agent
to allow the registrar to verify agent-proximity to the pledge
(issue #1) in UC2.</t>
  <t>Details on trust relationship between registrar-agent and
pledge (issue #5) included in UC2.</t>
  <t>Split of use case 2 call flow into sub sections in UC2.</t>
</list></t>

<t>From IETF draft 00 -&gt; IETF draft 01:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Update of scope in <xref target="sup-env"/> to include in
which the pledge acts as a server. This is one main motivation
for use case 2.</t>
  <t>Rework of use case 2 to consider the
transport between the pledge and the pledge-agent. Addressed is
the TLS channel establishment between the pledge-agent and the
pledge as well as the endpoint definition on the pledge.</t>
  <t>First description of exchanged object types (needs more work)</t>
  <t>Clarification in discovery options for enrollment endpoints at
the domain registrar based on well-known endpoints in
<xref target="discovery_eo"/> do not result in additional
/.well-known URIs. Update of the illustrative example.
Note that the change to /brski for the voucher related endpoints
has been taken over in the BRSKI main document.</t>
  <t>Updated references.</t>
  <t>Included Thomas Werner as additional author for the document.</t>
</list></t>

<t>From individual version 03 -&gt; IETF draft 00:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Inclusion of discovery options of enrollment endpoints at
the domain registrar based on well-known endpoints in
<xref target="discovery_eo"/> as replacement of section 5.1.3
in the individual draft. This is intended to support both use
cases in the document. An illustrative example is provided.</t>
  <t>Missing details provided for the description and call flow in
pledge-agent use case UC2, e.g. to
accommodate distribution of CA certificates.</t>
  <t>Updated CMP example in <xref target="exist_prot"/> to use
Lightweight CMP instead of CMP, as the draft already provides
the necessary /.well-known endpoints.</t>
  <t>Requirements discussion moved to separate section in
<xref target="req-sol"/>. Shortened description of proof
of identity binding and mapping to existing protocols.</t>
  <t>Removal of copied call flows for voucher exchange and registrar
discovery flow from <xref target="RFC8995"/> in <xref target="uc1"/> to avoid doubling or text or
inconsistencies.</t>
  <t>Reworked abstract and introduction to be more crisp regarding
the targeted solution. Several structural changes in the document
to have a better distinction between requirements, use case
description, and solution description as separate sections.
History moved to appendix.</t>
</list></t>

<t>From individual version 02 -&gt; 03:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Update of terminology from self-contained to authenticated
self-contained object to be consistent in the wording and to
underline the protection of the object with an existing
credential. Note that the naming of this object may be discussed.
An alternative name may be attestation object.</t>
  <t>Simplification of the architecture approach for the initial use
case having an offsite PKI.</t>
  <t>Introduction of a new use case utilizing authenticated
self-contain objects to onboard a pledge using a commissioning
tool containing a pledge-agent. This requires additional changes
in the BRSKI call flow sequence and led to changes in the
introduction, the application example,and also in the
related BRSKI-AE call flow.</t>
  <t>Update of provided examples of the addressing approach used in
BRSKI to allow for support of multiple enrollment protocols in
<xref target="addressing"/>.</t>
</list></t>

<t>From individual version 01 -&gt; 02:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Update of introduction text to clearly relate to the usage of
IDevID and LDevID.</t>
  <t>Definition of the addressing approach used in BRSKI to allow for
support of multiple enrollment protocols in <xref target="addressing"/>.  This
section also contains a first
discussion of an optional discovery mechanism to address
situations in which the registrar supports more than one enrollment
approach. Discovery should avoid that the pledge performs a trial
and error of enrollment protocols.</t>
  <t>Update of description of architecture elements and
changes to BRSKI in <xref target="architecture"/>.</t>
  <t>Enhanced consideration of existing enrollment protocols in the
context of mapping the requirements to existing solutions in
<xref target="req-sol"/> and in <xref target="exist_prot"/>.</t>
</list></t>

<t>From individual version 00 -&gt; 01:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Update of examples, specifically for building automation as
well as two new application use cases in <xref target="app-examples"/>.</t>
  <t>Deletion of asynchronous interaction with MASA to not
complicate the use case. Note that the voucher exchange can
already be handled in an asynchronous manner and is therefore
not considered further. This resulted in removal of the
alternative path the MASA in Figure 1 and the associated
description in <xref target="architecture"/>.</t>
  <t>Enhancement of description of architecture elements and
changes to BRSKI in <xref target="architecture"/>.</t>
  <t>Consideration of existing enrollment protocols in the context
of mapping the requirements to existing solutions in <xref target="req-sol"/>.</t>
