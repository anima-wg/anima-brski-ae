--- abstract

This document describes enhancements of
Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI, {{RFC8995}}) to support
end-to-end security and asynchronous operation of certficate enrollment
by supporting alternative enrollment protocols.
By making BRSKI flexible on the certificate enrollment protocol being used,
this document <!-- Bro: Ich habe BRSKI-AE immer mit this document/specification ersetzt. --> allows employing protocols such as CMP, where the origin of certificate
requests and responses can be authenticated independently of message transfer
by using self-contained (signature-wrapped) objects.

# Introduction

BRSKI, as defined in {{RFC8995}}, specifies a solution for
secure automated zero-touch bootstrapping of pledges <!-- Bro: ich würde durchgängig BRSKI Terminoligie verwenden-->
in an operational domain. This includes the discovery of the registrar
in the target domain, time synchronization, and the exchange of security
information necessary to establish trust between a pledge and the domain, and vice versa.

Security information about the target domain, specifically the
target domain certificate to be trusted by new pledges,
is exchanged utilizing voucher objects defined in {{RFC8366}}.
These vouchers are self-contained signed objects
originating from a Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority (MASA).
They may be provided online (synchronously) or offline (asynchronously)
via the domain registrar to the pledge.
A pledge can authenticate the voucher because it is shipped with a trust anchor
of its manufacturer such that it can verify signatures by the MASA.
<!-- stf: validation vs. verification. Here it should be verification   Bro: Ich denke eher es geht um validation, da es nicht nur die Signaturprüfung, sonder die komplette Chain Validation umfasse. Wir hatten die Begriffe mal in PKI glossar definiert: https://wiki.ct.siemens.de/x/BaC8EQ -->

Trust by the domain in a new pledge is established by enrolling an LDevID certificate of the pledge that is specific to the target domain.
For enrolling devices with such LDevID certificates,
BRSKI typically utilizes Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) {{RFC7030}}.
<!-- Bro: Ich würde hier die Beschreibung der EST Spezifika kürzen oder weglassen. Wir wollen in diesem Dokument ja nicht die Protokolle gegeneinander vergleichen. -->
While using EST has the advantage that the mutually authenticated TLS connection
established between the pledge and the registrar can be reused
for protecting also the message exchange for enrolling the LDevID certificate,
it has the limitation that this cannot not provide end-to-end security for the
certificate enrollment, because the TLS session terminates at the registrar,
while the enrollment is done via multiple consequtive hops
<!-- stf: AS BRSKI states the Registrar = RA would there still be a problem? May be as alternative: " ... if the enrollment is done via multiple consequtive hops." -->
Moreover, properly binding the proof-of-identity of a certification requester to<!-- Bro: proof-of-origin -> proof-of-identity -->
the proof-of-posession for the new private key via the so-called tls-unique is
conceptually non-trivial and requires specific support by the TLS implementation.
For these and other reasons (such as, more freedom w.r.t. proof-of-possession
methods), it may be preferable to use an alternative enrollment protocol,
such as CMP or CMC, that is more flexible and independent of the transfer level
because it represents certification requests as authenticated self-contained
objects. <!-- Bro: Ich würde grundsätzlich weniger technisch argumentieren, sondern allgemein sagen, dass es domain specific requirments geben kann, die ein andere Enrollment Protokoll fordern. Diese sind in Abschnitt 3.1 glaube ich schon highlevel gelistet. -->

When using EST, the pledge interacts via TLS with the domain
registrar, which acts as EST server and as registration authority (RA).
The TLS connection is mutually authenticated, where the pledge uses an
IDevID certificate issued by its manufacturer.
In order to provide proof-of-origin of the certificate request,
i.e., proof-of-identity of the requester, EST specifically relies on binding
the certification request to the underlying TLS channel via the 'tls-unique'
{{RFC5929}}. <!-- Bro: siehe Issue #16. Ich glaube, dass wir diese Detailtiefe hier in der Einleitung nicht mehr brauchen, nachdem die ANIMA WG den Draft schon angenommen hat. -->
The registrar terminates the security
association with the pledge and thus the binding between the
certification request and the authentication of the pledge via TLS.
The EST server uses the authenticated pledge identity provided by the IDevID
for checking the authorization of the pledge for the given certification request
before issuing to the pledge a domain-specific certificate (LDevID certificate).
This approach typically requires online or on-site availability of the RA
for performing the final authorization decision for the certification request.
This type of enrollment utilizing an online connection to the PKI
can be called *synchronous enrollment*.

The required RA/CA components and/or asset management system may not be
part of the registrar. They even may not be available on-site but rather be
provided by remote backend systems. The registrar or its site may have no online
connection with them or the connectivity may be intermittent.
This may be due to security requirements for operating the backend systems
or due to site deployments where on-site or always-online operation
may be not feasible or too costly.
In such cases the authorization of certification request based on an asset
management system will not or can not be performed on-site at enrollment time.
In this document, enrollment that is not performed in a (time-wise) consistent
way is called *asynchronous enrollment*.
Asynchronous enrollment requires a store-and-forward transfer of certification
requests along with the information needed for authenticating the requester.
This enables off-line processing the request at a later point in time.

A similar situation may occur through network segmentation, which is
utilized in industrial systems to separate domains with different
security needs. Here, a similar requirement arises if the communication
channel carrying the requester authentication is terminated before
the registrar/RA can authorize the certification request.
When a second communication channel is used to forward the certification
request to the RA and issuing CA, the requester authentication information
needs to be retained and ideally bound directly to the certification request.
This use case is independent of the time-wise limitations of the first use case.

There are basically two options for forwarding certification requests
along with requester authentication information:

* Having a trusted component (e.g., a local RA) in the target
  domain that stores the certification request combined with
  the requester authentication information (based on the IDevID)
  and potentially the information about successful verification of
  the proof-of-possession (of the corresponding private key) in a way
  preventing changes to the combined information.
  Note that the proof-of-identity and the proof-of-prossession
  may not have been bound cryptographically.
  When connectivity to backend PKI components is available, the trusted
  component forwards the certification request together with
  the requester information (authentication and proof-ofpossession) for further processing.
  This case offers only hop-by-hop security: the backend PKI must rely on the
  local pledge authentication result when performing the
  authorization and issuing the requested certificate.
  In BRSKI the trusted component is the EST server,
  co-located with the registrar in the target domain.

* Utilizing authenticated self-contained objects for the
  enrollment, directly binding the certification request and the
  requester authentication in a cryptographic way. This approach supports
  end-to-end security, reducing the need to trust in an intermediate domain
  component. Unauthorized modification of the requester
  information (request and authentication) can be detected during
  the verification of the authenticated self-contained object.

Focus of this document is the support of alternative enrollment protocols
that allow handling authenticated self-contained objects for device credential bootstrapping.
This enhancement of BRSKI is named BRSKI-AE,
where AE stands for both alternative enrollment protocols and asynchronous enrollment.
Like BRSKI, this specification results in the pledge storing an X.509 domain
certificate with the corresponding private key and sufficient information for verifying the domain
registrar identity (LDevID CA certificate) as well as
domain-specific X.509 device certificates (LDevID EE certificates).

The goals are to enhance BRSKI to

* support alternative enrollment protocols,

* support end-to-end security for enrollment, and

* make it applicable to use cases involving asynchronous enrollment.

This is achieved by

* extending the well-known URI approach with an additional path element
  indicating the enrollment protocol being used, and

* defining a certificate waiting indication and handling, for the case that the
  certifying component is (temporarily) not available.

This specification can be applied to both synchronous and asynchronous enrollment.

In contrast to BRSKI, this specification supports offering multiple enrollment protocols
on the infrastructure side, which enables pledges and their developers
to pick prefered one.

# Terminology

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

This document relies on the terminology defined in {{RFC8995}}.
The following terms are defined in addition:

EE:
: End entity, here called pledge.
  It is the entity that is onboarded to the target deployment domain.
  It holds a public-private key pair, for which it requests a public-key certificate.
  An identifier for the EE is given as the subject of the certificate.

RA:
: Registration authority, an optional system
  component to which a CA delegates certificate management functions
  such as authenticating requesters and performing authorization checks.

CA:
: Certification authority, issues certificates.

on-site:
: Describes a component or service or
  functionality available in the target deployment domain.

off-site:
: Describes a component or service or
  functionality available in an operator domain different from
  the target deployment domain. This may be a central site or a
  cloud service, to which only a temporary connection is available,
  or which is in a different administrative domain.

asynchronous communication:
: Describes a time-wise interrupted communication
  between a pledge (EE) and a registrar or PKI component.

synchronous communication:
: Describes a time-wise uninterrupted communication
  between a pledge (EE) and a registrar or PKI component.

authenticated self-contained object:
: Describes in this context an object
  that is cryptographically bound to an EE certificate
  (IDevID certificate or LDevID certificate) of a pledge. The
  binding is assumed to be provided through a digital signature
  of the actual object using the private key corresponding to
  the EE certificate.


# Scope of solution

## Supported environment {#sup-env}

This solution is intended to be used in domains that may have limited support
of on-site PKI services and comprises use cases like the following.

* There are requirements or implementation restrictions
  that do not allow the use of EST for enrolling LDevID certificates.

* Pledges and/or the target deployment domain already have an established
  certificate management approach different from EST that shall be reused
  (e.g., in brownfield installations).

* There is no registration authority available in the target domain.
  Connectivity to an off-site RA is intermittent or entirely offline.
  A store-and-forward mechanism is used
  for communicating with the off-site services.

* Authoritative actions of a local RA are limited and may not be sufficient
  for authorizing certification requests by pledges.
  Final authorization is done by an RA residing in the operator domain.


## Application Examples {#app-examples}

Bootstrapping is often handled differently, depending on the application domains.
The informative annex TBD-Ref provides illustrative examples from
various automation domains and operational setups.
They motivate the support of alternative enrollment protocols,
based on the operational environments in the examples.
Examples are provided for

* Rolling stock

* Building automation

* Electrical substation automation

* Electric vehile charging infrastructures

* Infrastructure isolation policy

* Domains with less operational security

<!-- stf: Auch nach der Diskussion gestern, eventuell ist es ausreichend die eigentlichen Application Examples in einen informative Annex zu bewegen. Ich habe den Text oben mal als Einleitung entsprechend angepasst. -->

### Rolling stock

Rolling stock or railroad cars contain a variety of sensors,
actuators, and controllers, which communicate within the railroad car
but also exchange information between railroad cars building a train,
with track-side equipment, and/or possibly with backend systems.
These devices are typically unaware of backend system
connectivity. Managing certificates may be done during maintenance
cycles of the railroad car, but can already be prepared during
operation. Preparation will include generating certification requests,
which are collected and later forwarded for
processing, once the railroad car is connected to the operator backend.
The authorization of the certification request is then done based on
the operator's asset/inventory information in the backend.

UNISIG has included a CMP profile for enrollment of TLS certificates of
on-board and track-side components in the Subset-137 specifying the ETRAM/ETCS
on-line key management for train control systems {{UNISIG-Subset-137}}.

### Building automation

In building automation scenarios, a detached
building or the basement of a building may be equipped with sensors, actuators,
and controllers that are connected with each other in a local network but
with only limited or no connectivity to a central building management system.
This problem may occur during installation time but also during operation.
In such a situation a service technician collects the necessary data
and transfers it between the local network and the central building management
system, e.g., using a laptop or a mobile phone.
This data may comprise parameters and settings
required in the operational phase of the sensors/actuators, like a
component certificate issued by the operator to authenticate against other
components and services.

The collected data may be provided by a domain registrar
already existing in the local network. In this case
connectivity to the backend PKI may be facilitated by the service
technician's laptop.
Alternatively, the data can also be collected from the
pledges directly and provided to a domain registrar deployed in a
different network as preparation for the operational phase. In this case, connectivity to the domain registrar
may also be facilitated by the service technician's laptop.


### Substation automation

In electrical substation automation scenarios, a control center typically hosts
PKI services to issue certificates for Intelligent Electronic Devices
(IEDs) operated in a substation. Communication between the substation
and control center is performed through a proxy/gateway/DMZ, which
terminates protocol flows. Note that {{NERC-CIP-005-5}} requires
inspection of protocols at the boundary of a security
perimeter (the substation in this case).
In addition, security management in substation automation assumes
central support of several enrollment protocols in order to support the
various capabilities of IEDs from different vendors. The IEC standard
IEC62351-9 {{IEC-62351-9}} specifies mandatory
support of two enrollment protocols: SCEP {{RFC8894}} and EST
{{RFC7030}} for the infrastructure side, while
the IED must only support one of the two.


### Electric vehicle charging infrastructure

For electric vehicle charging infrastructure, protocols have been
defined for the interaction between the electric vehicle and the
charging point (e.g., ISO 15118-2 {{ISO-IEC-15118-2}})
as well as between the charging point and the charging point operator
(e.g. OCPP {{OCPP}}). Depending on the authentication
model, unilateral or mutual authentication is required. In both cases
the charging point uses an X.509 certificate to authenticate itself
in TLS connections between the electric vehicle and
the charging point. The management of this certificate depends,
among others, on the selected backend connectivity protocol.
In the case of OCPP, this protocol is meant to be the only communication
protocol between the charging point and the backend, carrying all
information to control the charging operations and maintain the
charging point itself. This means that the certificate management
needs to be handled in-band of OCPP. This requires the ability to
encapsulate the certificate management messages in a transport-independent way.
Authenticated self-containment will support this by
allowing the transport without a separate enrollment protocol,
binding the messages to the identity of the communicating endpoints.


### Infrastructure isolation policy

This refers to any case in which network infrastructure is normally
isolated from the Internet as a matter of policy, most likely for
security reasons. In such a case, limited access to external PKI
services will be allowed in carefully controlled short periods of
time, for example when a batch of new devices is deployed, and
forbidden or prevented at other times.


### Less operational security in the target domain

The registration authority performing (at least part of) the authorization of a
certification request is a critical PKI component and therefore requires higher
operational security than components utilizing the issued
certificates for their security features. CAs may also demand higher
security in the registration procedures. Especially the CA/Browser
forum currently increases the security requirements in the certificate
issuance procedures for publicly trusted certificates.
There may be situations where the target domain does not offer a sufficient
level of security to operate a registration authority and therefore wants to
transfer this service to a backend service that offers a higher security level.


# Requirements discussion and mapping to solution elements {#req-sol}

For the requirements discussion we assume that the domain
registrar receiving a certification request as an authenticated
object is not always the (final) authorization point for this
certification request.
If the domain registrar is the only authorization
point and the pledge has a direct connection to it, BRSKI can be used directly.
Note that BRSKI-AE may still be needed
in this case, for instance when the pledge prefers a protocol other than EST.

Based on the intended target environment described in {{sup-env}} and
the application examples described in {{app-examples}}, the following
requirements are derived to support authenticated self-contained
objects as container carrying certification requests and further
information to support asynchronous operation.

At least the following properties are required:

* proof-of-possession: demonstrates access to the private
  key corresponding to the public key contained in a certification request.
  This is typically achieved by a self-signature using the private key.

* proof-of-identity: provides data origin authentication of a data object
  such as a certificate request. This typically is achieved by a signature
  using the private key associated with the IDevID certificate of the pledge,
  or, in case of certificate updates, with the certificate to be updated.

Here is an incomplete list of solution examples,
based on existing technology described in IETF documents:

* Certification request objects: Certification requests are
  data structures protecting only the integrity of the contained data
  and providing proof-of-possession for a (locally generated) private key.
  Examples for certification request data structures are:

  * PKCS#10 {{RFC2986}}. The structure is self-signed to
    protect its integrity and prove possession of the private key
    that corresponds to the included public key of the requester.

  * CRMF {{RFC4211}}. Also this structure supports
    integrity protection and proof-of-possession,
    typically by a self-signature generated over (part of) the structure
    with the private key corresponding to the included public key.
    CRMF also supports further proof-of-possession methods
    for types of keys that do not support any signature algorithm.

  The integrity protection of certification request fields includes the public
  key because it is part of the data signed by the corresponding private key.
  Yet note that for the above examples this is not sufficient to provide data
  origin authentication, i.e., proof-of-identity. This extra property can be
  achieved by an additional binding to the IDevID of the pledge.
  This binding to source authentication supports the
  authorization decision for the certification request. The binding of data
  origin authentication to the certification request may be
  delegated to the protocol used for certificate management.

* Solution options for proof-of-identity: The certification request should be
  bound to an existing authenticated credential (here, IDevID) to enable a proof
  of identity and, based on it, an authorization of the certification request.
  The binding may be achieved through security options in an
  underlying transport protocol such as TLS if the authorization of the
  certification request is (completely) done at the next communication hop.
  This binding can also be done in a transport-independent way by wrapping the
  certification request with signature employing an existing credential. In
  the BRSKI context, this will be the IDevID initially, the LDevID for renewals.
  This requirement is addressed by existing enrollment protocols
  in various ways, such as:

  * EST {{RFC7030}} utilizes PKCS#10 to
    encode the certification request. The Certificate Signing
    Request (CSR) may contain a binding to the underlying TLS session
    by including the tls-unique value in the self-signed CSR structure.
    The tls-unique value results from the TLS handshake.
    Since the TLS handshake includes client
    authentication and the pledge utilizes its IDevID for it,
    the proof-of-identity can be provided by the binding to
    the TLS session. This is supported in EST using the
    /simpleenroll endpoint. As an alternative to binding to the underlying
    authentication in the transport layer, {{RFC7030}} sketches wrapping the CSR
    with a Full PKI Request message using an existing certificate.

  * SCEP {{RFC8894}} supports using a shared secret (passphrase) or
    an existing certificate to protect CSRs based on
    SCEP Secure Message Objects using CMS wrapping
    ({{RFC5652}}). Note that the wrapping using
    an existing IDevID credential in SCEP is referred to as renewal.
    Thus SCEP does not rely on the security of the underlying transfer.

  * CMP {{RFC4210}} supports using a shared secret (passphrase) or an existing
    certificate, which may be an IDevID credential, to authenticate
    certification requests via the PKIProtection structure in a PKIMessage.
    The certification request is typically encoded utilizing CRMF,
    while PKCS#10 is supported as an alternative.
    Thus CMP does not rely on the security of the underlying transfer.

  * CMC {{RFC5272}} also supports utilizing a shared secret (passphrase) or
    an existing certificate to protect certification requests,
    which can be either in CRMF or PKCS#10 format.
    The proof-of-identity can be provided as part of a FullCMCRequest,
    based on CMS {{RFC5652}} and signed with an existing IDevID credential.
    Thus CMC does not rely on the security of the underlying transfer.

Note that, besides the existing enrollment protocols, there is
ongoing work in the ACE WG to define an encapsulation of EST messages in
OSCORE, which will result in a TLS-independent way of protecting EST.
This approach {{I-D.selander-ace-coap-est-oscore}}
may be considered as a further variant.


# Adaptations to BRSKI {#uc1}

In order to support alternative enrollment protocols, asynchronous enrollment,
and more general system architectures,
BRSKI-AE lifts some restrictions of BRSKI {{RFC8995}}.
This way, authenticated self-contained objects such as those described in
{{req-sol}} above can be used for certificate enrollment.

The enhancements needed are kept to a minimum in order to ensure reuse of
already defined architecture elements and interactions.
In general, the communication follows the BRSKI model and utilizes the existing
BRSKI architecture elements.
In particular, the pledge initiates communication with the domain registrar
and interacts with the MASA as usual.


##  Architecture {#architecture}

The key element of BRSKI-AE is that the authorization of a
certification request MUST be performed based on an authenticated
self-contained object, binding the certification request to the
authentication using the IDevID. This enables interaction with
off-site or off-line PKI (RA/CA) components.
In addition, the authorization of the certification request MAY be done not only
by the domain registrar but by PKI components residing in the backend
of the domain operator (off-site) as described in {{sup-env}}.
Also, the certification request MAY be piggybacked on another protocol.
This leads to generalizations in the
placement and enhancements of the logical elements as shown in {{uc1figure}}.

{: #uc1figure title='Architecture overview using off-site PKI components' artwork-align="left"}

The architecture overview in {{uc1figure}} has
the same logical elements as BRSKI, but with more flexible placement.
The PKI component that performs the authorization decision for certification
request messages MAY be off-site or in the central domain of the operator,
to which the deployment or on-site domain of the pledge
may have no or only temporary (intermittent) connectivity.
This is to underline the option that the authorization decision for the
certification request may also be performed in the backend.

The following list describes the components in the deployment target domain
of the pledge as well as the base services.

* Join Proxy: same functionality as described in BRSKI {{RFC8995}}.

* Domain Registrar / Enrollment Proxy: in BRSKI-AE,
  the domain registrar has mostly the same functionality as in BRSKI, namely
  to facilitate the communication of the pledge with the MASA and the PKI.
  Regarding the enrollment of the pledge to the deployment domain,
  there is a difference in the authorization of certification requests.
  BRSKI-AE allows to perform this in the operator's backend (off-site),
  and not just directly at the domain registrar.

* Voucher exchange: the voucher exchange with the MASA  via
  the domain registrar is performed as described in BRSKI.

* Certificate enrollment:
  the domain registrar in the deployment domain supports the
    adoption of the pledge in the domain based on the voucher
    request. Nevertheless, it may not have sufficient
    information for authorizing the certification request.
  If the authorization is done off-site, the domain registrar MUST forward
  the certification request to the RA to perform the authorization there.
  In this case  the certification request object MUST include
  a proof-of-origin such that the authorization to be based on the
  included pledge identity information.
  As stated above, this SHOULD be done by an additional signature
  using the IDevID.
    The domain registrar here MAY act as an enrollment proxy or
    local registration authority. It is also able to handle the
  situation that it has only intermittent connection to an off-site PKI
    by storing the authenticated certification request and
    forwarding it to the RA upon reestablished connectivity.
    As authenticated self-contained objects are used, it
    requires an enhancement of the domain registrar. This is
    done by supporting alternative enrollment approaches
    (protocol options, protocols, encoding) and generalizing the
    addressing scheme to communicate with the domain registrar
    (see {{addressing}}).

The following list describes the vendor-related components/service
outside the deployment domain.

* MASA: general functionality as described in BRSKI {{RFC8995}}.
  Note that the interaction with the MASA may be
  synchronous (voucher request with nonce) or asynchronous
  (voucher request without nonce).

* Ownership tracker: as defined in BRSKI.

The following list describes the operator-related components/service
operated in the off-site backend of the domain.

* PKI RA: Performs certificate management functions (validation
  of requests, where final authorization of certification requests
  may be done by interaction with an asset management system, etc.)
  for issuing, updating, and revoking certificates for a domain
  as a centralized infrastructure for the domain operator.
  The asset management system may be integrated with the RA directly
  or may be a separate component that is possibly located off-site.

* PKI CA: Performs certificate generation by signing the certificate structure
  provided in already authenticated and authorized certification requests.

Based on BRSKI and the architectural changes, the original protocol
flow is divided into three phases showing commonalities and
differences to the original approach as follows.

* Discovery phase: same as in BRSKI {{RFC8995}} steps (1) and (2)

* Voucher exchange with deployment domain registrar:
  same as in BRSKI steps (3) and (4).

* Enrollment phase: step (5) is changed to support the use of
  authenticated self-contained objects.


## Message Exchange

The behavior of a pledge as described in {{RFC8995}} is kept with one exception.
After finishing the imprinting phase (4)
the enrollment phase (5) MUST be performed with a method supporting
authenticated self-contained objects. Note that EST with simple-enroll
cannot be applied here, as it binds the pledge authentication with
the existing IDevID to the transport channel (TLS) rather than to
the certification request object directly. This authentication in
the transport layer is not visible / verifiable at the authorization
point in the off-site domain. {{exist_prot}} discusses
selected suitable enrollment protocols and options applicable.


### Pledge - Registrar discovery and voucher exchange {#discovery}

The discovery phase and voucher exchange is applied as specified in {{RFC8995}}.


### Registrar - MASA voucher exchange {#vexchange}

This voucher exchange is performed as specified in {{RFC8995}}.


### Pledge - Registrar - RA/CA certificate enrollment {#enroll}

As stated in {{req-sol}}, the enrollment MUST be
performed using an authenticated self-contained object providing
not only proof-of-possession but also proof-of-identity (source authentication).

{: #enrollfigure title='Certificate enrollment' artwork-align="left"}

The following list provides an abstract description of the flow
depicted in {{enrollfigure}}.

* CA Cert Request: The pledge SHOULD request the latest relevant
  CA Certificates. This ensures that the pledge has the
  complete set of current CA certificates beyond the
  pinned-domain-cert (which may be the domain registrar certificate
  contained in the voucher).

* CA Cert Response: SHOULD contain at least the CA certificate of
  the issuing CA.

* Attribute Request: Typically, the automated bootstrapping occurs
  without local administrative configuration of the pledge.
  Nevertheless, there are cases in which the pledge may also
  include additional attributes specific to the deployment domain
  into the certification request. To get these attributes in
  advance, the attribute request SHOULD be used.

* Attribute Response: SHOULD contain the attributes to be included
  in the subsequent certification request.

* Cert Request: This certification request MUST contain the authenticated
  self-contained object ensuring both proof-of-possession of the
  corresponding private key and proof-of-identity of the requester.

* Cert Response: The certification response message MUST contain on success the
  requested certificate and MAY include potentially further information, like
  certificates of intermediary CAs on the certification path.

* Cert Waiting: Optional waiting indication for the pledge, which SHOULD retry
  after a given time. For this a request identifier is necessary.
  This request identifier may be either part of the enrollment
  protocol or can derived from the certification request.

* Cert Polling: This is SHOULD be used by the pledge to query the registrar
  whether the certification request meanwhile has been processed;
  can be answered either by another Cert Waiting, or a Cert Response.

* Cert Confirm: positive or negative confirmation message by the pledge
  the SHOULD be sent after receiving and verifying a new certificate.

* PKI/Registrar Confirm: An acknowledgment by the PKI or domain registrar
  that MUST be sent on reception of the Cert Confirm.

The generic messages described above MAY be implemented using various
enrollment protocols supporting authenticated self-contained request objects,
as described in {{req-sol}}. Examples are available in {{exist_prot}}.


### Pledge - Registrar - enrollment status telemetry

The enrollment status telemetry is performed as specified in {{RFC8995}}
although in BRSKI this is described as part of the enrollment phase.


### Addressing Scheme Enhancements {#addressing}

BRSKI-AE provides generalizations to the addressing scheme defined in
BRSKI {{RFC8995}} to accommodate alternative enrollment protocols that
use authenticated self-contained objects for certification requests.
As this is supported by various existing enrollment protocols,
they can be directly employed (see also {{exist_prot}}).

The addressing scheme in BRSKI for client certificate request and
CA certificate distribution function during the enrollment uses
the definition from EST {{RFC7030}}, here on the
example on simple enrollment: "/.well-known/est/simpleenroll"
This approach is generalized to the following notation:
"/.well-known/&lt;enrollment-protocol&gt;/&lt;request&gt;"
in which &lt;enrollment-protocol&gt; can be an already existing protocol or
a newly defined approach. Note that enrollment is considered here
as a sequence of at least a certification request and a certification
response. In case of existing enrollment protocols the following
notation is used proving compatibility to BRSKI:

* &lt;enrollment-protocol&gt;: MUST reference the protocol being used,
  which MAY be EST {{RFC7030}} as in BRSKI
  or CMP, CMC, SCEP, or a newly defined approach.
  Note: additional endpoints (well-known URIs) at the registrar
  may need to be defined by the utilized enrollment protocol.

* &lt;request&gt;: depending on the utilized enrollment protocol,
  the &lt;request&gt; path component MUST describe the required operation at the
  registrar side. Enrollment protocols are expected to
  define their request endpoints, as done by existing protocols
  (see also {{exist_prot}}).


## Domain registrar support of alternative enrollment protocols {#discovery_eo}

Well-known URIs for various endpoints on the domain registrar are
already defined as part of the base BRSKI specification. In
addition, alternative enrollment endpoints MAY be supported at the
domain registrar. The pledge will recognize whether its
preferred enrollment option is supported by the domain registrar
by sending a request to its preferred enrollment endpoint
and evaluating the HTTP response status code.

The following figure provides an illustrative example for a domain
registrar supporting several options for EST as well as for
CMP to be used in BRSKI-AE. The listing contains the supported
endpoints to which the pledge may connect for bootstrapping. This
includes the voucher handling as well as the enrollment endpoints.
The CMP related enrollment endpoints are defined as well-known URIs
in CMP Updates {{I-D.ietf-lamps-cmp-updates}}
and the Lightweight CMP profile {{I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile}}.

# Examples for signature-wrapping using existing enrollment protocols {#exist_prot}

This section maps the requirements to support proof-of-possession and
proof-of-identity to selected existing enrollment protocols.

Note that the work in the ACE WG described in
{{I-D.selander-ace-coap-est-oscore}} may be considered
here as well, as it also addresses the encapsulation of EST in a way to
make it independent of the underlying TLS connection using OSCORE,
which also entails that authenticated self-contained objects are used.


## EST Handling

When using EST {{RFC7030}}, the following aspects and constraints
need to be considered and the given extra requirements SHALL be observed:

* proof-of-possession is provided by using the specified PKCS#10
  structure in the request.

* proof-of-identity SHALL be achieved by signing the certification request
  object using the Full PKI Request option (including the /fullcmc endpoint).
  This provides sufficient
  information for the RA to make an authorization decision on the
  received certification request.
  Note: EST references CMC {{RFC5272}} for the
  definition of the Full PKI Request. For proof-of-identity, the
  signature of the SignedData of the Full PKI Request is
  performed using the IDevID credential of the pledge.

* TBD RFC Editor: please delete /\* TBD: in this case the binding to
  the underlying TLS connection is not necessary. \*/

* When the RA is temporarily not available, as per {{RFC7030}} section 4.2.3,
  an HTTP status code 202 SHOULD be returned by the
  Registrar. The pledge in this case will retry a /simpleenroll
  with a PKCS#10 request. Note that if the TLS connection is taken
  down during the waiting period, the PKCS#10 request needs to be
  rebuilt if it contains the unique identifier (tls_unique) from
  the underlying TLS connection for the binding.

* TBD RFC Editor: please delete /\* TBD: clarification of retry for
  fullcmc is necessary as not specified in the context of EST \*/


## CMP Handling

Instead of using general CMP {{RFC4210}}, this specification
refers to the Lightweight CMP Profile
{{I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile}}, as it
restricts full-featured CMP to the functionality needed here.

When using this variant of CMP, the following requirements SHALL be observed:

* For proof-of-possession, the approach defined in the Lightweight CMP Profile
  {{I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile}} section 4.1.1 (based on CRMF)
  or 4.1.4 (based on PCKS#10) SHALL be applied.

* proof-of-identity SHALL be provided by using signature-based
  protection of the certificate request message as outlined in section
  3.2. of {{I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile}}.

* When the RA/CA is not available, a waiting indication SHALL be
  returned in the PKIStatus by the Registrar as specified in sections 4.4 and
  5.1.2 of {{I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile}} for delayed delivery.

* Requesting CA certificates and certificate request attributes SHALL be
  implemented a specified in sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.3 of
  {{I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile}}.


# IANA Considerations

This document does not require IANA actions.


# Security Considerations

The security considerations as laid out in BRSKI {{RFC8995}} apply for
the discovery and voucher exchange as well as for the status exchange information.

The security considerations as laid out in the Lightweight CMP Profile
{{I-D.ietf-lamps-lightweight-cmp-profile}} apply as far as CMP is used.

# History of changes TBD RFC Editor: please delete {#app_history}

From IETF draft 04 -> IETF draft 05:

* David von Oheimb became the editor.

* Streamline wording, improve grammar, etc. throughout the text.

* Shift the emphasis towards supporting alternative enrollment protocols.

* Update the title accordingly - prelimary change to be approved.

From IETF draft 03 -> IETF draft 04:

* Moved UC2 related parts defining the pledge in responder mode to a
  separate document. This required changes and adaptations in several
  sections. Main changes concerned the removal of the subsection for UC2
  as well as the removal of the YANG model related text as it is not
  applicable in UC1.

* Updated references to the Lightweight CMP Profile.

* Added David von Oheimb as co-author.


From IETF draft 02 -> IETF draft 03:

* Housekeeping, deleted open issue regarding YANG voucher-request
  in UC2 as voucher-request was enhanced with additional leaf.

* Included open issues in YANG model in UC2 regarding assertion
  value agent-proximity and CSR encapsulation using SZTP sub module).


From IETF draft 01 -> IETF draft 02:

* Defined call flow and objects for interactions in UC2. Object format
  based on draft for JOSE signed voucher artifacts and aligned the
  remaining objects with this approach in UC2 .

* Terminology change: issue #2 pledge-agent -> registrar-agent to
  better underline agent relation.

* Terminology change: issue #3 PULL/PUSH -> pledge-initiator-mode
  and pledge-responder-mode to better address the pledge operation.

* Communication approach between pledge and registrar-agent
  changed by removing TLS-PSK (former section TLS establishment)
  and associated references to other drafts in favor of relying on
  higher layer exchange of signed data objects. These data objects
  are included also in the pledge-voucher-request and lead to an
  extension of the YANG module for the voucher-request (issue #12).

* Details on trust relationship between registrar-agent and
  registrar (issue #4, #5, #9) included in UC2.

* Recommendation regarding short-lived certificates for
  registrar-agent authentication towards registrar (issue #7) in
  the security considerations.

* Introduction of reference to agent signing certificate using SKID
  in agent signed data (issue #11).

* Enhanced objects in exchanges between pledge and registrar-agent
  to allow the registrar to verify agent-proximity to the pledge
  (issue #1) in UC2.

* Details on trust relationship between registrar-agent and
  pledge (issue #5) included in UC2.

* Split of use case 2 call flow into sub sections in UC2.


From IETF draft 00 -> IETF draft 01:

* Update of scope in {{sup-env}} to include in
  which the pledge acts as a server. This is one main motivation
  for use case 2.

* Rework of use case 2 to consider the
  transport between the pledge and the pledge-agent. Addressed is
  the TLS channel establishment between the pledge-agent and the
  pledge as well as the endpoint definition on the pledge.

* First description of exchanged object types (needs more work)

* Clarification in discovery options for enrollment endpoints at
  the domain registrar based on well-known endpoints in
  {{discovery_eo}} do not result in additional
  /.well-known URIs. Update of the illustrative example.
  Note that the change to /brski for the voucher related endpoints
  has been taken over in the BRSKI main document.

* Updated references.

* Included Thomas Werner as additional author for the document.


From individual version 03 -> IETF draft 00:

* Inclusion of discovery options of enrollment endpoints at
  the domain registrar based on well-known endpoints in
  {{discovery_eo}} as replacement of section 5.1.3
  in the individual draft. This is intended to support both use
  cases in the document. An illustrative example is provided.

* Missing details provided for the description and call flow in
  pledge-agent use case UC2, e.g. to
  accommodate distribution of CA certificates.

* Updated CMP example in {{exist_prot}} to use
  Lightweight CMP instead of CMP, as the draft already provides
  the necessary /.well-known endpoints.

* Requirements discussion moved to separate section in
  {{req-sol}}. Shortened description of proof
  of identity binding and mapping to existing protocols.

* Removal of copied call flows for voucher exchange and registrar
  discovery flow from {{RFC8995}} in {{uc1}} to avoid doubling or text or
  inconsistencies.

* Reworked abstract and introduction to be more crisp regarding
  the targeted solution. Several structural changes in the document
  to have a better distinction between requirements, use case
  description, and solution description as separate sections.
  History moved to appendix.


From individual version 02 -> 03:

* Update of terminology from self-contained to authenticated
  self-contained object to be consistent in the wording and to
  underline the protection of the object with an existing
  credential. Note that the naming of this object may be discussed.
  An alternative name may be attestation object.

* Simplification of the architecture approach for the initial use
  case having an offsite PKI.

* Introduction of a new use case utilizing authenticated
  self-contain objects to onboard a pledge using a commissioning
  tool containing a pledge-agent. This requires additional changes
  in the BRSKI call flow sequence and led to changes in the
  introduction, the application example,and also in the
  related BRSKI-AE call flow.

* Update of provided examples of the addressing approach used in
  BRSKI to allow for support of multiple enrollment protocols in
  {{addressing}}.


From individual version 01 -> 02:

* Update of introduction text to clearly relate to the usage of
  IDevID and LDevID.

* Definition of the addressing approach used in BRSKI to allow for
  support of multiple enrollment protocols in {{addressing}}.  This
  section also contains a first
  discussion of an optional discovery mechanism to address
  situations in which the registrar supports more than one enrollment
  approach. Discovery should avoid that the pledge performs a trial
  and error of enrollment protocols.

* Update of description of architecture elements and
  changes to BRSKI in {{architecture}}.

* Enhanced consideration of existing enrollment protocols in the
  context of mapping the requirements to existing solutions in
  {{req-sol}} and in {{exist_prot}}.


From individual version 00 -> 01:

* Update of examples, specifically for building automation as
  well as two new application use cases in {{app-examples}}.

* Deletion of asynchronous interaction with MASA to not
  complicate the use case. Note that the voucher exchange can
  already be handled in an asynchronous manner and is therefore
  not considered further. This resulted in removal of the
  alternative path the MASA in Figure 1 and the associated
  description in {{architecture}}.

* Enhancement of description of architecture elements and
  changes to BRSKI in {{architecture}}.

* Consideration of existing enrollment protocols in the context
  of mapping the requirements to existing solutions in {{req-sol}}.

* New section starting {{exist_prot}} with the
  mapping to existing enrollment protocols by collecting
  boundary conditions.
